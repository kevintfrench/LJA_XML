<div type="epistle"><head>To The Readers Studious In Histories.</head>

<p>THE order obserued in the description of Britaine, by reason of the
necessarie diuision thereof into bookes and chapters growing out of
the varietie of matters therein conteined, seemed (in my iudgement) so
conuenient a course deuised by the writer, as I was easilie induced
thereby to digest the historie of England immediatlie following into
the like method: so that as in the one, so likewise in the other, by
summarie contents foregoing euerie chapter as also by certeine
material titles added at the head of euerie page of the said historie,
it is a thing of no difficultie to comprehend what is discoursed and
discussed in the same.</p>

<p>Wherein (sith, histories are said to be the registers of memorie
and the monuments of veritie) all louers of knowlege, speciallie
historicall, are aduisedlie to marke (among other points) the seuerall
and successiue alterations of regiments in this land: whereof it was
my meaning to haue made an abstract, but that the same is
sufficientlie handled in the first booke 

<note place="marg"><xref>Pag. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 26, 27, 28, 49, 50, 51,
of the description: and pag, 765, 766, of the historie of
England.</xref></note>

and fourth chapter of the description of Britaine; whereto if the
seuenth chapter of the same booke be also annexed, there is litle or
no defect at all in that case wherof iustlie to make complaints.</p>

<p>Wherfore by remitting the readers to those, I reape this aduantage,
namelie a, discharge of a forethought *entity* purposed labour, which as
to reduce into some plausible forme was a worke both of time, paine
and studie: so seeming vnlikelie to be comprised in few words (being a
matter of necessarie and important obseruation) occasion of tediousnes
is to and fro auoided; speciallie to the reader, who is further to be
aduertised, that the computations of yeares here and there expressed,
according to the indirect direction of the copies whense they were
deriued and drawne, is not so absolute (in some mens opinion) as it
might haue beene: howbeit iustifiable by their originals.</p>

<pb n="426"/>

<p>Wherin hereafter (God prolonging peace in the church and
common-welth that the vse of bookes may not be abridged) such diligent
care shall be had, that in whatsoeuer the helpe of bookes will doo
good, or conference with antiquaries auaile, there shall want no will
to vse the one and the other. And yet it is not a worke for euerie
common capacitie, naie it is a toile without head or taile euen for
extraordinarie wits, to correct the accounts of former ages so many
hundred yeares receiued, out of vncerteinties to raise certeinties,
and to reconcile writers dissenting in opinion and report. But as this
is vnpossible, so is no more to be looked for than may be performed:
and further to inquire as it is against reason, so to vndertake more
than may commendablie be atchiued, were fowle follie.</p>

<p>WHAT manner of people did first inhabite this our country, which

knowne; neither can it be decided fr*entity* whence the first

 for the more part fabulous (that alwaies excepted which we find in
 the holie scriptures) I wish not any man to leane to that which shall
 be here set downe as to an infallible truth, sith I doo but onlie
 shew other mens coniectures, grounded neuerthelesse vpon likelie

<note place="marg">No Ilands at the first, as some

 by the report of Dominicus Marius Niger that in the beginning, when
 God framed the world, and diuided the waters apart from the earth,
 this Ile was then a parcell of the continent, and ioined without any
 separation of sea to the maine land. But this opinion (as all other
 the like vncerteinties) I leaue to be discussed of by the learned:
 howbeit for the first inhabitation of this Ile with people, I haue
 thought good to set downe in part, what may be gathered out of such
 writers as haue touched that matter, and may s*entity*eme to giue
 some light vnto the knowledge thereof.</p>

<p>First therefore Iohn Bale our countrieman, who in his time greatlie

 of such antiquities, dooth probablie coniecture, that this land was
 inhabited and replenished with people long before the floud, at that
 time in the which the generation of mankind (as Moses writeth) began
 to multiplie vpon the vniuersall face of the earth: and therfore it
 followeth, that as well this land was inhabited with people long
 before the daies of Noah, as any the other countries and parts of the
 world beside. But when they had once forsaken the ordinances
 appointed them by God, and betaken them to new waies inuented of
 themselues, such loosenesse of life ensued euerie where, as brought
 vpon them the great deluge and vniuersall floud, in the which
 perished as well the inhabitants of these quarters, as the residue of
 the race of mankind, generallie dispersed in euerie other part of the
 whole world, onelie Noah *entity* his familie excepted, who by the
 prouidence and pleasure of almightie God was preserued from the rage
 of those waters, to recontinue and repaire the new generation of man
 of vpon earth.</p>

recordeth) 

<note place="marg"><xref>In comment, super 4. lib. Berosus de antiquit, lib. 1. Annius ut suor.</xref></note>

and reason also enforceth, Noah was the onlie monarch of
all the world, and as the same Annius gathereth by the account of
Moses in the 100. yeare after the flood, Noah diuided the earth among
his thr*entity*e sonnes; assigning to the possession of his eldest
sonne all that portion of land which now is knowne by the name of
Asia; to his second sonne Cham, he appointed all that part of the
world which now is called Affrica: and to his third sonne Iapher was
allotted all Europa, with all the Iles therto belonging, wherin among
other was conteined this our Ile of Britaine, with the other Iles
thereto perteining.</p>

<note rend="smallcaps" type="rubric" place="marg">IAPHET AND HIS SONNES.</note>

<note place="marg"><xref>Iohannes Bodinus ad fac. hist. cagn. I'ranciscus Tarapha.</xref></note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">IAPHET</hi> the third son of Noah, of some called Iapetus, and of others, Atlas Maurus (because he departed this life in Mauritania) was the first (as Bodinus affirmeth by the authoritie and consent of the Hebrue, Gr*entity*eke *entity* Latine Writers) that peopled the countries of Europe, which afterward he diuided among his sonnes: of whom Tuball (as Tarapha affirmeth) obteined the kingdome of Spaine. Gomer had dominion ouer the Italians, and (as Berosus and diuers other authors agr*entity*e) Samothes was the founder of Celtica, which conteined in it (as Bale witnesseth) a great part of Europe, but speciallie those countries which now are called by the names of Gallia and Britannia.</p>

<note place="marg">Britaine inhabited shortlie after the floud.</note>

<p>Thus was this Iland inhabited and peopled within 200 y*entity*eres after the floud by the children of Iaphet the sonne of Noah: *entity* this is not onlie prooued by Annius, writing vpon Berosus, but also confirmed by Moses in the scripture, where he writeth, that of the offspring of Iaphet, the Iles of the Gentiles (wherof Britain is one) were sorted into regions in the time of Phaleg the sonne of Hiber, who was borne at the time of the diuision of languages. 

<note place="marg"><xref>Theophilus episcop. Antioch. ad Anfol. lib. 2.</xref></note>
<note place="marg">The words of Theophilus a doctor of the church, who liued an. Dom. 160.</note>

 Herevpon Theophilus hath these words: "C*entity*m priscis temporibus pauci forent homines in Arabia *entity* Chaldaea, post linguarum diuisionem aucti *entity* multiplicati paulatim sunt: hinc quidam abierunt versus orientem, quidam concessere ad partes maioris continentis, alij porr*entity* profecti sunt ad septentrionem sedes quaesituri, nec pri*entity*s desierunt terram vbiq; occupare, qu*entity*m etiam Britannos in Arctois climatibus accesserint, *entity*c." <emph>That is;</emph> "When at the first there were not manie men in Arabia and Chaldaea, it came to passe, that after the diuision of toongs, they began somewhat better to increase and multiplie, by which occasion some of them went toward the east, and some toward the parts of the great maine land: diuers went also northwards to seeke them dwelling places, neither staid they to replenish the earth as they went, till they came vnto the Iles of Britaine, lieng vnder the north pole." Thus far Theophilus.</p>
<p>These things considered, Gildas the Britaine had great reason ta thinke, that this countrie had bene inhabited from the beginning. And Polydor Virgil was with no lesse consideration hereby induced to confesse, that the Ile of Britaine had receiued inhabitants foorthwith after the floud.</p>

 that Xenophon and Iosephus doo constantlie report (although Diogenes Laertius be against it) that both the Gr*entity*ekes and other nations receiued their letters and learning first from these countries. Of this king and his learning arose a sect of philosophers (saith Annius) first in

 that the whole nation did not onelie take the name of them, but the Iland it selfe (as Bale and doctor Caius agree) came to be called Samothea, which was the first peculiar name that euer it had, and by the which it was especiallie knowne before the arriuall of Albion.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">MAGUS</hi> the sonne of Samothes, after the death of his father, was the second king of Celtica,

Neomagus sir Thomas Eliot writeth to haue stood where the citie of Chester now standeth; Niomagus, George Lillie placeth where the towne of Buckingham is now remaining. Beside this, Bale dooth so highlie commend the foresaid Magus for his learning renowmed ouer all the world, that he would haue the Persians, and other nations of the south and west parts, to deriue the name of their diuines called <emph>Magi</emph> from him. In d*entity*ed Rauisius Textor, and sir Iohn Prise affirme, that in the daies of Plinie, the Britons were so expert in art magike, that they might be thought to haue first deliuered the same to the Persians. What the name of <emph>Magus</emph> importeth, and of what profession the 
 <emph>Magi</emph> were, Tullie declareth at large, and Mantuan in briefe, after this maner:

 countrie of Gallia, and the Ile Samothea, wherein as (D. Caius writeth) he founded certaine publike places for them that professed learning, which Berosus affirmeth to be done, to the intent to restraine the wilfull outrage of men, being as then but raw and void of all ciuilitie. Also it is thought by Annius, that he was the first author of those kind of philosophers, which were called Sarronides, of whom Diodorus Siculus writeth in this sort: "There are 

<note place="marg"><xref> Lib. 6.</xref></note>

 (saith he) among the Celts certaine diuines and philosophers called Sarronides, whom aboue all other they haue in great estimation. For it is the manner among them, not without a philosopher to make anie sacrifice: sith they are of bel*entity*efe, that sacrifices ought onelie to be made by such as are skilfull in the diuine mysteries, as of those who are n*entity*erest vnto God, by whose intercession they thinke all good things are to be required of God, and whose aduise they vse and follow, as well in warre as in peace."</p>

This prince is commended <pb n="430"/>by Berosus to be so plentifullie indued with wisedome and learning, that Annius taketh him to be the vndoubted author of the begining and name of the philosophers called Druides, whome Caesar and all other ancient Gr*entity*eke and Latine writers doo affirme to haue had their begining in Britaine, and to haue bin brought from thence into Gallia, insomuch that when there arose any doubt in that countrie touching any point of their discipline, they did repaire to be resolued therein into Britaine, where, speciallie in the Ile of Anglesey (as

 Humfrey Llhoyd witnesseth) they made their principall abode. Touching their vsages many things are written by Aristotle, Socion, Plinie, Laertius, Bodinus, and others: which I will gather in briefe, and set downe as followeth. They had (as Caesar saith) the charge of common *entity* priuate sacrifices, the discussing of points of religion, the bringing vp of youth, the determining of matters in variance with full power to interdict so manie from the sacrifice of 

<note place="marg"><xref>Hist. an. lib. 1.</xref></note>

 their gods and the companie of men, as disobeied their award. Polydore affirmeth, how they taught, that mens soules could not die, but departed from one bodie to another, and that to the 

<note place="marg"><xref>De diui. lib. 1.</xref></note>

 intent to make men valiant and dreadlesse of death. Tullie writeth, that partlie by tokens, and partlie by surmises, they would foretell things to come. And by the report of Hector Boetius, some of them were not ignorant of the immortalitie of the one and euerlasting God.

 All these things they had written in the Greeke toong, insomuch that Wolf. Lazius (vpon the report of Marcellinus) declareth how the Gr*entity*eke letters were first brought to Athens by Timagenes from the Druides. And herevpon it commeth also to passe, that the British toong hath in it remaining at this day some smacke of the Gr*entity*eke. Among other abuses of the Druides, they had (according to Diodorus) one custome to kill men, and by the falling, bleeding, and dismembring of them, to diuine of things to come: for the which and other wicked practises, their sect was first condemned for abhominable (as some haue written) and

 by Berosus) for inuention of dities and musicke, wherein Annius of Viterbo writeth, that he trained his people: and of such as excelled in this knowledge, he made an order of philosophicall poets or heraulds, calling them by his owne name Bardi. And it should s*entity*eme by doctor Caius and master Bale, that Caesar found some of them here at his arriuall in this Ile, and reported that they had also their first begining in the same. The profession and vsages of these Bardi, Nonnius, Strabo, Diodorus, Stephanus, Bale, and sir Iohn Prise, are in effect reported after this sort. They did vse to record the. noble exploits of the ancient capteins, and to drawe the pedegr*entity*es and genealogies of such as were liuing. They would frame pleasant dities and songs, learne the same by heart, and sing them to instruments at solemne feasts and assemblies of noble men and gentlemen. Wherefore they were had in so high estimation, that if two hosts had bene readie ranged to ioine in battell, and that any of them had fortuned to enter among them, both the hosts (as well the enimies as the friends) would haue holden their hands, giuen eare vnto them, and ceassed from fignt, vntill these Bards had gone out of the battell. Of these Bards Lucane saith,

<p>Because the names of these poets were neither discrepant from the ciuilitie of the Romans, nor repugnant to the religion of the Christians, they (of all the other sects before specified) were suffered onlie to continue vnabolished in all ages, insomuch that there flourished of them among the Britains (according to Bale) before the birth of Christ, Plenidius and Oronius:

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. Polydor.</emph></note>

 of Armorica, which is now called little Britaine.</p>
<p>But that the authorities afore recited are sufficient to proue the time that this Iland was first inhabited by the Celts, the old possessors of Gallia; not onelie the n*entity*ernesse of the regions, but the congruence of languages, two great arguments of originals doo fullie confirme the same. Bodinus writeth vpon report, that the British and Celtike language was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Bodinus.</emph></note>

 all one. But whether that be true or not, I am not able to affirme, bicause the Celtike toong is long sithens growne wholie out of vse. Howbeit some such Celtike words as remaine in the writings of old authours may be perceiued to agr*entity*e with the Welsh toong, being the vncorrupted sp*entity*ech of the ancient Britains. In d*entity*ed Pausanias the Grecian maketh mention 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pausanias</emph></note>

 how the Celts in their language called a horsse <emph>Marc:</emph> and by that name doo the Welshmen call a horsse to this day: and the word <emph>Trimarc</emph> in Pausanias, signifieth in the Celtike toong, thr*entity*e horsses.</p>
<p>Thus it appeareth by the authoritie of writers, by situation of place, and by affinitie of language, that this Iland was first found and inhabited by the Celts, that there name from Samothes to Albion continued here the space of 310 yeares or there abouts. And

 vnder his subiection. And herevpon it resteth, that Iohn Textor, and Polydor Virgil made mention, that light shippes were first inuented in the British seas, and that the same were couered round with the hides of beasts, for defending them from the surges and waues of the water.</p>
<p>This Albion being put by his father in possession of this Ile of Britaine, within short time subdued the Samotheans, the first inhabitantes thereof, without finding any great resistance, for that (as before ye haue heard) they had giuen ouer the practise of all warlike and other painefull exercises, and through vse of effeminate pleasures, wherevnto they had giuen themselues ouer, they were become now vnapt to withstand the force of their enimies: and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Nichol. Perot. Rigmanus Philesius. Aristotle. Hum. Lhoyd.</emph></note>

 so (by the testimonie of Nicholaus Perottus, Rigmanus Philesius, Aristotle, and Humfrey Llhoyd, with diuers other, both forraine *entity* home-writers) this Iland was first called by the name of Albion, hauing at one time both the name and inhabitants changed from the line of Iaphet vnto the accursed race of Cham.</p>
<p>This Albion (that thus changed the name of this Ile) and his companie, are called giants, which signifieth none other than a tall kind of men, of that vncorrupt stature and highnesse 

<note place="marg"><emph>Berosus.</emph></note>

 naturallie incident to the first age (which Berosus also s*entity*emeth to allow, where he writeth, that Noah was one of the giants) and were not so called only of their monstrous greatnesse, as the common people thinke (although in deed they exceeded the vsuall stature of men now in these daies) but also for that they tooke their name of the soile where they were

<note place="marg"><emph>Bale.</emph> Bergion brother to Albion. Hercules Lybicus.</note>

<p>But now to our purpose. As Albion held Britaine in subiection, so his brother Bergion kept Ireland and the Orkenies vnder his rule and dominion, and hearing that their coosine Hercules Lybicus hauing finished his conquests in Spaine, meant to passe through Gallia into Italie, against their brother Lestrigo that oppressed Italie, vnder subiection of him *entity* other of his brethren the sons also of Neptune; as well Albion as Bergion assembling their powers togither, passed ouer into Gallia, to stoppe the passage of Hercules, whose intention was to vanquish and destroie those tyrants the sonnes of Neptune, *entity* their complices that kept diuers countries and regions vnder the painefull yoke of their heauie thraldome.</p>

<pb n="433"/>
<p>The cause that moued Hercules thus to pursue vpon those tyrants now reigning thus in 

<note place="marg">The cause why Hercules pursued his coosins.</note>

 the world, was, for that not long before, the greatest part of them had conspired togither and slaine his father Osiris, notwithstanding that they were nephues to the same Osiris, as sonnes to his brother Neptune, and not contented with his slaughter, they diuided his carcase also amongst them, so that each of them got a peece in token of reioising at their murtherous atchiued enterprise.</p>
<p>For this cause Hercules (whome Moses calleth Laabin) proclamed warres against them all in reuenge of his fathers death: and first he killed Triphon and Busiris in Aegypt, then Anteus in Mauritania, *entity* the Gerions in Spaine, which enterprise atchiued, he led his armie towardes Italie, and by the way passed through a part of Gallia, where Albion and Bergion 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pomp. Mela.</emph></note>

 hauing vnited their powers togither, were readie to receiue him with battell: and so n*entity*ere to the mouth of the riuer called Rhosne, in Latine <emph>Rhodanus,</emph> they met *entity* fought. At the first there was a right terrible and cruell conflict betwixt them. And albeit that Hercules had the greatest number of men, yet was it verie doubtfull a great while, to whether part the glorie of that daies worke would bend. Whereupon when the victorie began outright to turne vnto Albion, and to his brother Bergion, Hercules perceiuing the danger and likelihood of vtter losse of that battell, speciallie for that his men had wasted their weapons, he caused those that stood still and were not otherwise occupied, to stoope downe, and to gather vp stones, whereof in that place there was great plentie, which by his commandement they bestowed so fr*entity*elie vpon their enimies, that in the end h*entity*e obteined the victorie, and did 

<note place="marg">Hercules discomfitcth his enimies Albion is slaine.</note>

 not only put his aduersaries to flight, but also slue Albion there in the field, togither with his brother Bergion, and the most part of all their whole armie. This was the end of Albion, and his brother Bergion, by the valiant prowesse of Hercules, who as one appointed by Gods prouidence to subdue the cruell *entity* vnmercifull tyrants, spent his time to the benefit of mankind, deliuering the oppressed from the heauie yoke of miserable thraldome, in euerie place where he came.</p>
<p>And by the order of this battell w*entity*e maye learne whereof the poets had their inuention, 

<note place="marg">The occasion of the fable of Iupiters heiping his son Hercules. How this Ile was called Albion, of the glant Albion. <emph>Iohn Bale.</emph></note>

 when they faine in their writings, that Iupiter holpe his sonne Hercules, by throwing downe stones from heauen in this battell against Albion and Bergion. Moreouer, from henceforth was this Ile of Britaine called Albion (as before we haue said) after the name of the said Albion: because he was established chiefe ruler and king thereof both by his grandfather Osiris, and his father Neptune that cunning sailour reigning therein (as Bale saith) by the space of 44. yeares, till finally he was slaine in maner afore remembred by his vncle Hercules Libicus.</p>
<p>After that Hercules had thus vanquished and destroied his enimies, h*entity*e passed to and fro thorough Gallia, suppressing the tyrants in euerie part where he came, and restoring the people vnto a reasonable kinde of libertie, vnder lawfull gouernours. This Hercules (as we find) builded the citie Alexia in Burgongne, nowe called Alize. Moreouer, by Lilius Giraldus in the life of Hercules it is auouched, that the same Hercules came ouer hither into Britaine. And this dooth Giraldus write by warrant of such Britons as (saith the) haue so written themselues, which thing peraduenture he hath read in Gildas the ancient Briton poet: a booke that (as he confesseth in the 5. dialog of his histories of poets) he hath s*entity*ene. The same thing also is confirmed by the name of an head of land in Britaine called <emph>Promontorium Herculis,</emph> as in Ptolomie ye may read, which is thought to take name of his arriuall at that place. Thus much for Albion and Hercules.</p>
<p>But now, whereas it is not denied of anie, that this Ile was called ancientlie by the name 

<note place="marg">Diuers opinions why this Ile was calied Albion. S*entity*e more hereof in the description.</note>

 of Albion: yet there be diuers opinions how it came by that name: for manie doo not allow of this historie of Albion the giant. But for so much as it apperteineth rather to the description than to the historie of this Ile, to rip vp and lay foorth the secret mysteries of such matters: and because I thinke that this opinion which is here auouched, how it tooke that name of the forsaid Albion, sonne to Neptune, may be confirmed with as good authoritie as some of the other, I here passe ouer the rest, *entity* proc*entity*ed with the historie.</p>

<pb n="434"/>
<p>When Albion chiefe capteine of the giants was slaine, the residue that remained at home in the Ile, continued without any rule or restraint of law, in so much that they fell to such a dissolute order of life, that they s*entity*emed little or norhing to differ from brute beasts: and those are they which our ancient chronicles call the giants, who were so named, as well for the huge proportion of their stature (sithens as before is said, that age brought foorth far greater men than are now liuing) as also for that they were the first, or at the least the furthest in remembrance of any that had inhabited this countrie. For this word <emph>Gigines,</emph> or <emph>Gegines,</emph> from whence our word giant (as some take it) is deriued, is a Gr*entity*eke word, and signifieth, Borne or bred of or in the earth, for our fore-elders specially the Gentiles, being ignorant of the true beginning of mankind, were persuaded, that the first inhabitants of any countrie were bred out of the earth, and therefore when they could go no higher, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Terrae filius</emph> what it signifieth.</note>

 reckoning the descents of their predecessours, they would name him <emph>Terrae filius,</emph> The sonne of the earth: and so the giants whom the poets faine to haue sought to make battell against heauen are called the sonnes of the earth: and the first inhabitants generally of euery 

<note place="marg"><emph>Aborigines, Indigenae.</emph></note>

 countrie were of the Gr*entity*ekes called <emph>Gigines,</emph> or <emph>Gegines,</emph> and of the Latines <emph>Aborigines,</emph> and <emph>Inrdigenae,</emph> that is, People borne of the earth from the beginning, and comming from no other countrie, but bred within the same.</p>
<p>These giants and first inhabitants of this Ile continued in their beastlie kind of life vnto the arriuall of the ladies, which some of our chronicles ignorantly write to be the daughters of Dioclesian the king of Assyria, whereas in d*entity*ed they haue b*entity*ene deceiued, in taking the 

<note place="marg">The mistaking of the name of Dioclesianus for Danaus.</note>

 word <emph>Danaus</emph> to be short written for <emph>Dioclesianus:</emph> and by the same meanes haue diuers words and names b*entity*ene mistaken, both in our chronicles, and in diuers other ancient written woorks. But this is a fault that learned men should not so much trouble themselues about, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hugh the Italian. Harding. Iohn Rous</emph> out of <emph>Dauid Pencair.</emph></note>

 considering the same hath bin alreadie found by sundrie authors ling sithens, as Hugh the Italian, Iohn Harding, Iohn Rouse of Warwike, and others, speciallie by the helpe of Dauid Pencair a British historie, who recite the historie vnder the name of Danaus and his daughters. And because we would not any man to thinke, that the historie of these daughters of Danaus is onelie of purpose deuised, and brought in place of Dioclesianus, to excuse the imperfection of our writers, whereas there was either no such historie (or at the least no such 

<note place="marg"><emph>Nennius</emph></note>

 women that arriued in this Ile) the authoritie of Nennius a Briton writer may be auouched, who wrote aboue 900. yeares past, and maketh mention of the arriuall of such ladies.</p>

<note place="marg">Belus priscus.</note>

<p>To be short, the historie is thus. Belus the sonne of Epaphus, or (as some writers 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>D m</unclear> poeticum.</emph></note>

 haue) of Neptune and Libies (whome Isis after the death of Apis maried) had issue two sonnes: the first Danaus, called also Armeus; and Aegyptus called also Rameses: these 

<note place="marg">Lanaus. Aegyptus <emph>Higinus.</emph></note>

 two were kings among the Aegyptians, Danaus the elder of the two, hauing in his rule the vpper region of Aegypt, had by sundrie wiues 50. daughters, with whome his brother Aegyptus, gaping for the dominion of the whole, did instantlie labour, that his sonnes being also 50. in number, might match. But Danaus hauing knowledge by some prophesie or oracle, that a sonne in law of his should be his death, refused so to bestow his daughters. Hereupon grew warre betwixt the brethren, in the end whereof, Danaus being the weaker, was inforced to fi*entity*e his countrie, and so prepared a nauie, imbarked himselfe and his daughters, and with them passed ouer into Gr*entity*ece, where he found meanes to dispossesse Gelenor (sonne to Stenelas king of Argos) of his rightfull inheritance, driuing him out of his countrie, and reigned in his place by the assistance of the Argiues that had conceiued an hatred towardes Gelenor, and a great liking towardes Danaus, who in verie deed did so farre excell the kings that had reigned there before him, that the Gr*entity*ekes in remembrance of him were after called Danai.</p>
<p>But his brother Aegyptus, taking great disdaine for that he and his sonnes were in such sort despised of Danaus, sent his sonnes with a great armie to make warre against their vncle, giuing them in charge not to returne, till they had either slaine Danaus, or obteined his daughters in mariage. The yoong gentlemen according to their fathers commandement, being arriued in Greece, made such warre against Danaus, that in the end he was constrained <pb n="435"/>to giue vnto those his 50. nephues his 50. daughters, to ioine with them in mariage, and so they were. But as the prouerbe saith, "In trust appeared treacherie." For on the first night of the mariage, Danaus deliuered to ech of his daughters a sword, charging them that when their husbands after their bankets and pastimes were once brought into a sound sl*entity*epe, ech of them should slea hir husband, menacing them with death vnlesse they fulfilled his commandement. They all therefore obeied the will of their father, Hypermnestra onely excepted, with whom preuailed more the loue of kinred and wedlocke, than the feare of hir fathers displeasure: for shee alone spared the life of hir husband Lynceus, waking him out of his sl*entity*epe, and warning him to depart and fl*entity*e into Aegypt to his father. He therefore hauing all the wicked practises reuealed to him by his wife, followed hir aduice, and so escaped.</p>
<p>Now when Danaus perceiued how all his daughters had accomplished his commandement, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pausanias</emph></note>

 sauing onelie Hypermnestra, he caused hir to be brought forth into iudgement, for disobeieng him in a matter wherein both the safetie and losse of his life rested: but she was acquitted by the Argiues, *entity* discharged. Howbeit hir father kept hir in prison, and s*entity*eking to find out other husbands for his other daughters that had obeied his pleasure in sleaing their first husbands, long it was yer he could find any to match with them: for the heinous offense committed in the slaughter of their late husbands, was yet too fresh in memorie, and their bloud not wiped out of mind. Neuerthelesse, to bring his purpose the better to passe, he made proclamation, that his daughters should demand no ioinctures, and euerie suter should take his choise without respect to the age of the ladie, or abilitie of him that came to make his choise, but so as first come best serued, according to their owne phantasies and likings. Howbeit when this policie also failed, *entity* would not serue his turne, he deuised a game of running, ordeining therewith, that whosoeuer got the best price should haue the first choise among all the sisters; and he that got the second, should choose next to the first; and so foorth, ech one after an other, according to the triall of their swiftnesse of foote</p>
<p>How much this practise auailed, I know not: but certeine it is, diuers of them were bestowed, either by this or some other meanes, for we find that Autonomes was maried to Architeles, Chrysanta or (as Pausanias saith) Scea was matched with Archandrus, Amaome with Neptunus Equestris, on whome he begat Nauplius.</p>
<p>But now to returne vnto Lynceus, whome his wife Hypermnestra preserued, as before ye 

<note place="marg"><emph>Higinus.</emph></note>

 haue heard. After he was once got out of the reach and danger of his father in law king Danaus, he gaue knowledge thereof to his wife, in raising a fire on heigth beaconwise, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pausanias.</emph></note>

 accordingly as she had requested him to doo at his departure from hir: and this was at a place which afterwards tooke name of him, and was called Lyncea. Upon his returne into Aegypt, he gaue his father to vnderstand the whole circumstance of the trecherous crueltie vsed by his vncle and his daughters in the murder of his brethren, and how hardly he himselfe had escaped death out of his vncles handes. Wherevpon at time conuenient he was furnished foorth with men and ships by his father, for the sp*entity*edie reuenge of that heinous, vnnaturall and most disloiall murder, in which enterprise he sped him foorth with such diligence, that in short time he found meanes to dispatch his vncle Danaus, set his wife Hypermnestra at libertie, and subdued the whole kingdome of the Argiues.</p>
<p>This done, he caused the daughters of Danaus (so many as remained within the limits of his dominion) to be sent for, whome he thought not worthie to liue, bicause of the cruell murther which they had committed on his brethren: but yet for that they were his wiues sisters, he would not put them to death, but commanded them to be thrust into a ship, without maister, mate or mariner, and so to be turned into the maine ocean sea, and to take and abide such fortune as should chance vnto them. These ladies thus imbarked 

<note place="marg"><emph>Harding</emph> and <emph>Iohn Rous</emph> out of <emph>Dauid Pencair.</emph></note>

 and left to the mercy of the seas, by hap were brought to the coasts of this Ile then called Albion, where they tooke land, and in s*entity*eking to prouide themselues of victuals by pursute of wilde beasts, met with no other inhabitants, than the rude and sauage giants mentioned <pb n="436"/>before, whome our historiens for their beastlie kind of life doo call diuells. With these monsters did these ladies (finding none other to satisfie the motions of their sensuall lust) ioine in the act of venerie, and ingendred a race of people in proportion nothing differing from their fathers that begat them, nor in conditions from their mothers that bare them.</p>
<p>But now peraduenture ye wil thinke that I haue forgotten my selfe, in rehearsing this historie of the ladies arriuall here, bicause I make no mention of Albina, which should be the eldest of the sisters, of whome this land should also take the name of Albion. To this we answer, that as the name of their father hath bene mistaken, so likewise hath the whole course of the historie in this behalfe. For though we shall admit that to be true which is rehearsed (in maner as before ye haue heard) of the arriuall here of those ladies; yet certeine it is that none of them bare the name of Albina, from whome this land might be called Albion. For further assurance whereof, if any man be desirous to know all their 

<note place="marg"><emph>Higinus.</emph></note>

 names, we haue thought good here to rehearse them as they be found in Higinus, Pausanias,

These were the names of those ladies the daughters of Danaus: howbeit, which they were that should arriue in this Ile, we can not say: but it sufficeth to vnderstand, that none of them hight Albina. So that, whether the historie of their landing here should be true or not, it is all one for the matter concerning 

<note place="marg">See more in the description.</note>

 the name of this Ile, which vndoubtedlie was called Albion, either of Albion the giant (as before I haue said) or by some other occasion.</p>
<p>And thus much for the ladies, whose strange aduenture of their arriuall here, as it may s*entity*eme to manie *entity* (with good cause) incredible, so without further auouching it for truth I leaue it to the consideration of the reader, to thinke thereof as reason shall moue him sith I s*entity*e not how either in this, or in other things of such antiquitie, we cannot haue sufficient warrant otherwise than by likelie coniectures. Which as in this historie of the ladies they are not most probable, yet haue we shewed the likeliest, that (as we thinke) may be d*entity*emed to agr*entity*e with those authors that haue written of their comming into this Ile But as for an assured proofe that this Ile was inhabited with people before the comming of Brute, I trust it may suffice which before is recited out of Annius de Viterbo, Theophilus, Gildas, and other, although much more might be said: as of the comming hither of Osiris, 

<note place="marg">Vlysses in Britaine.</note>

 as well as in the other parties of the world: and likewise of Vlysses his being here, who in performing some vow which he either then did make, or before had made, erected an altar 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iulius Solinus.</emph></note>

 in that part of Scotland which was ancientlie called Calidonia, as Iulius Solinus Polyhistor in plaine words dooth record.</p>
<p>*entity* Vpon these considerations I haue no doubt to deliuer vnto the reader, the opinion of those that thinke this land to haue bene inhabited before the arriuall here of Brute, trusting it may be taken in good part, sith we haue but shewed the coniectures of others, till time that some sufficient learned man shall take vpon him to decipher the doubts of all these matters. Neuerthelesse, I thinke good to aduertise the reader that these stories of Samothes. Magus, Sarron, Druis, and Bardus, doo relie onelie vpon the authoritie of Berosus, whom most diligent antiquaries doo reiect as a fabulous and counterfet author, and Vacerius bath laboured to prooue the same by a speciall treatise latelie published at Rome.</p>

<p>HITHERTO haue we spoken of the inhabitants of this Ile before the comming of Brute, although some will n*entity*eds haue it, that he was the first which inhabited the same with his people descended of the Troians, some few giants onelie excepted whom he vtterlie destroied, and left not one of them aliue through the whole Ile. But as we shall not doubt of Brutes comming hither, so may we assuredly thinke, that he found the Ile peopled either with the generation of those which Albion the giant had placed here, or some other kind of people whom he did subdue, and so reigned as well ouer them as ouer those which he brought with him.</p>
<p>This Brutus, or Brytus [for this letter (Y) hath of ancient time had the sounds both of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Humfr. Lhoyd.</emph></note>

<note place="marg"><emph>Harding. Alex. Neuil. W. Har.</emph></note>

 it, the author of that booke (whatsoeuer he was) and such other as follow him, are deceiued onelie in this point, mistaking the matter, in that Posthumus the sonne of Aeneas (begotten of his wife Lauinia, and borne after his fathers deceasse in Italie) was called Ascanius, who had issue a sonne named Iulius, who (as these other doo coniecture) was the father of Brute, that noble chieftaine and aduenturous leader of those people, which being descended (for the more part in the fourth generation) from those Troians that escaped with life, when that roiall citie was destroied by the Gr*entity*ekes, got possession of this woorthie and most famous Ile.</p>
<p>To this opinion Giouan Villani a Florentine in his vniuersall historie, speaking of Aeneas and his ofspring kings in Italie, s*entity*emeth to agr*entity*e, where he saith: "Siluius (the sonne of Aeneas by his wife Lauinia) fell in loue with a n*entity*ece of his mother Lauinia, and by hir had a sonne, of whom she died in trauell, and therefore was called Brutus, who after as he grew in some stature, and hunting in a forrest slue his father vnwares, and therevpon for feare of his grandfather Siluius Posthumus he fled the countrie, and with a retinue of such as followed him, passing through diuers seas, at length he arriued in the Ile of Britaine."</p>
<p>Concerning therefore our Brute, whether his father Iulius was sonne to Ascanius the sonne of Aeneas by his wife Creusa, or sonne to Posthumus called also Ascanius, and sonne to Aeneas by his wife Lauinia, we will not further stand.

His grandfather (whether the same was Posthumus, or his elder brother) hearing of this great misfortune that had chanced to his sonne Siluius, liued not long after, but died for verie greefe and sorow (as is supposed) which he conceiued thereof. And the yoong gentleman, immediatlie after he had slaine his father (in maner before alledged) was banished his countrie, and therevpon got him into Grecia, where trauelling the countrie, he lighted by chance among some of the Troian ofspring, and associating himselfe with them, grew by meanes of the linage (whereof he was descended) in proces of time into great reputation among them: chieflie by reason there were yet diuers of the Troian race, and that of great authoritie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pausanias.</emph></note>

 in that countrie. For Pyrrhus the sonne of Achilles, hauing no issue by his wife Hermione, maried Andromache, late wife vnto Hector: and by hir had thr*entity*e sonnes Molossus, Pileus, and Pergamus, who in their time grew to be of great power in those places and countries, and their ofspring likewise: whereby Brutus or Brytus wanted no frienuship. For euen at his first comming thither, diuers of the Troians that remained in seruitude, being desirous of libertie, by flocks resorted vnto him. And amongst other, Assaracus was one, whom Brute intertained, receiuing at his hands the possession of sundrie forts and places of defense, before that the king of those parties could haue vnderstanding or knowledge of any such thing. Herewith also such as were readie to make the aduenture with him, repaired to him on ech side, wherevpon he first placed garisons in those townes which had bene thus deliuered vnto him, and afterwards with Assaracus and the residue of the multitude he withdrew into the mountains n*entity*ere adioining. And thus being made strong with such assistance, by consultation had with then that were of most authoritie about him, wrote vnto the king of that countrie called Pandrasus, in forme as followeth.

<text><body><div1 type="letter"><head rend="italic">A Letter Of Brute To Pandrasus, As I Find It Set Downe In Galfride Monumetensis.</head>
<p>"<hi rend="smallcap">BRUTE</hi> leader of the remnant of the Troian people, to Pandrasus king of the Greekes, sendeth greeting. Bicause it hath beene thought a thing vnworthie, that the people descended of the noble linage of Dardanus should be otherwise dealt with than the honour of their nobilitie dooth require: they haue withdrawne themselues within the close couert of the woods. For they haue chosen rather (after the maner of wild beasts) to liue on flesh and herbs in libertie, than furnished with all the riches in the world to continue vnder the yoke of seruile thraldome. But if this their dooing offend thy mightie highnesse, they are not to be blamed, but rather in this behalfe to be pardoned, sith euerie captiue prisoner is desirous to be restored vnto his former estate and dignitie. You therefore pitieng their case, vouchsafe to grant them their abridged libertie, and suffer them to remaine in quiet within these woods which they haue got into their possession: if not so, yet giue them licence to depart forth of this countrie into some other parts."</p>
		</div1></body></text></p>

<p>The sight of these letters, and request in them conteined, made Pandrasus at the first somewhat amazed, howbeit deliberating further of the matter, and considering their small number, he made no great account of them, but determined out of hand to suppresse them 

<note place="marg">Pandrasus prepareth an armie to suppresse the Troian ofspring. Sparatinum.</note>

 by force, before they should grow to a greater multitude. And to bring his intention the better to passe, he passed by a towne called Sparatinum, *entity* marching toward the woods where he thoght to haue found his enimies, he was suddenlie assalted by Brute, who with three thousand men came foorth of the woods, and fiercelie setting vpon his enimies, made great slaughter of them, so that they were vtterlie discomfited, *entity* sought by flight to saue

 to stay the Grecians from fl*entity*eing, and calling them backe againe did get some of them togither, placed them in order, and began a new field: but it nothing auailed, for the Troians, preasing <pb n="439"/>vpon him, tooke him prisoner, slue and scattred his companie, and ceased not till they had rid the fields of all their aduersaries.</p>
<p>This doone, Brute entering the towne, furnished it with six hundred able souldiours, 

<note place="marg">Brute entreth into Sparatinum.</note>

 and afterwards went backe to the residue of his people that were incamped in the woods, where he was receiued with vnspeakeable ioy for this prosperous atchiued enterprise. But although this euill successe at the first beginning sore troubled Pandrasus, as well for the losse of the field, as for the taking of his brother, yet was he rather kindled in desire to s*entity*eke reuenge, than otherwise discouraged. And therefore assembling his people againe togither that were scattered here and there, he came the next day before the towne of Sparatinum, where he thought to haue found Brute inclosed togither with the prisoners, and therfore he shewed his whole endeuour by hard siege and fierce assaults to force them within to yeeld.</p>
<p>To conclude, so long he continued the siege, till victuals began to waxe scant within, so that there was no way but to yeeld, if present succour came not to remoue the siege: wherevpon they signified their necessitie vnto Brute, who for that he had not power sufficient to fight with the enimies in open field, he ment to giue them a camisado in the night season, and so ordered his businesse, that inforsing a prisoner (named Anacletus whome he had taken in the last battell) to serue his turne, by constreining him to take an oth (which he durst not for conscience sake breake) he found means to encounter with his enimies vpon the aduantage, that he did not onelie ouerthrowe their whole power, but

<p>To all these conditions (bicause they touched not the prerogatiue of his kingdome) Pandrasus did willinglie agr*entity*e, and likewise performed.</p>

<note place="marg">Goffarius hauing renewed his forces, fighteth eftsoones with Brute.</note>

<p>Here Goffarius with such Galles as were assembled to his aid, gaue battell againe vnto the Troians that were incamped to abide his comming.

<p>This policie was put in practise, and tooke such effect as the deuisers themselues wished: for the Galles being sharplie assailed on the front by Brute and his companie, were now with the sudden comming of Corineus (who set vpon them behind on their backes) brought into such a feare, that incontinentlie they tooke them to flight, whom the Troians egerlie pursued, making no small slaughter of them as they did ouertake them. In this battell Brute lost manie of his men, and amongst other one of his nephues named Turinus, after he had shewed maruellous proofe of his manhood.

<p>But to our matter concerning Brute, who after he had obteined so famous a victorie, albeit there was good cause for him to reioise, yet it sore troubled him to consider that his numbers dailie decaied, and his enimies still increased, and grew stronger: wherevpon resting doubtfull

<p>WHEN Brute had entred this land, immediatlie after his arriuall (as writers doo record) he searched the countrie from side to side, and from end to end, finding it in most places verie fertile and plentious of wood and grasse, and full of pleasant springs and faire riuers.

 the rocks there, not farre from Douer, and so dispatched him: by reason whereof the place was named long after, <emph>The fall or leape of Gogmagog,</emph> but afterward it was called <emph>The fall of Douer.</emph> For this valiant d*entity*ed, and other the like seruices first and last atchiued, Brute gaue vnto Corineus the whole countrie of Cornwall. To be briefe, after that Brute had 

<note place="marg">Cornwall giuen to Corineus.</note>

 destroied such as stood against him, and brought such people vnder his subiection as he found in the Ile, and searched the land from the one end to the other: he was desirous to build a citie, that the same might be the seate roiall of his empire or kingdome. Wherevpon he chose a plot of ground lieng on the north side of the riuer of Thames, which by good consideration s*entity*emed to be most pleasant and conuenient for any great multitude of inhabitants, aswell for holsomnesse of aire, goodnesse of soile, plentie of woods, and commoditie of the riuer, seruing as well to bring in as to carrie out all kinds of merchandize and things necessarie for the gaine, store, and vse of them that there should inhabit.</p>
<p>Here therefore he began to build and lay the foundation of a cite, in the tenth or (as other thinke) in the second yeare after his arriuall, which he named (saith Gal. Mon.) Troinouant, or (as Hum. Llhoyd saith) Troinewith, that is, new Troy, in remembrance of that noble citie of Troy from whence he and his people were for the greater part descended.</p>
<p>When Brutus had builded this citie, and brought the Iland fullie vnder his subiection, he by the aduise of his nobles commanded this Ile (which before hight Albion) to be called Britaine, and the inhabitants Britons after his name, for a perpetuall memorie that he was the first bringer of them into the land. In this meane while also he had by his wife. iii. sonnes, the first named Locrinus or Locrine, the second Cambris or Camber, and the third Albanactus or Albanact. Now when the time of his death drew n*entity*ere, to the first he betooke the gouernment of that part of the land nowe knowne by the name of England: so that the same was long after called Loegria, or Logiers, of the said Locrinus. To the second he <pb n="444"/>appointed the countrie of Wales, which of him was first named Cambria, diuided from Loegria by the riuer of Seuerne. To his third sonne Albanact he delivered all the north part of the Ile, afterward called Albania, after the name of the said Albanact: which portion of the said Ile lieth beyond the Humber northward. Thus when Brutus had diuided the Ile of Britaine (as before is mentioned) into 3. parts, and had gouerned the same by the

It is Written that he had by his wife three daughters without other issue, whose names were Gonorilla, Regan, and Cordeilla, which daughters he greatly loued, but specially Cordeilla the yoongest farre aboue the two elder. When this Leir therefore was come to great yeres, *entity* began to waxe vnweldie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 through age, he thought to vnderstand the affections of his daughters towards him, and preferre hir whome he best loued, to the succession ouer the kingdome. Whervpon he first asked Gonorilla the eldest, how well she loued him: who calling hir gods to record, protested that she "loued him more than hir owne life, which by right and reason

 should be most d*entity*ere vnto hir. With which answer the father being well pleased, turned to the second, and demanded of hir how well she loued him: who answered (confirming hir saiengs with great othes) that she loued him more than toong could expresse, and farre aboue all other creatures of the world."</p>
<p>Then called he his yoongest daughter Cordeilla before him, and asked of hir what account she made of him, vnto whome she made this answer as followeth: "Knowing the great 

<note place="marg">The answer of the yoongest daughter.</note>

 loue and fatherlie zeale that you haue alwaies borne towards me (for the which I maie not answere you otherwise than I thinke, and as my conscience Ieadeth me) I protest vnto you, that I haue loued you euer, and will continuallie (while I liue) loue you as my naturall father. And if you would more vnderstand of the loue that I beare you, assertaine your selfe, that so much as you haue, so much you are woorth, and so much I loue you, and no

 more. The father being nothing content with this answer, married his two eldest daughters, the one vnto Henninus the duke of Cornewall, and the other vnto Maglanus the duke of Albania, betwixt whome he willed and ordeined that his land should be diuided after his death, and the one halfe thereof immediatlie should be assigned to them in hand: but for the third daughter Cordeilla he reserued nothing."</p>
<p>Neuertheles it fortuned that one of the princes of Gallia (which now is called France) whose name was Aganippus, hearing of the beautie, womanhood, and good conditions of the said Cordeilla, desired to haue hir in mariage, and sent ouer to hir father, requiring that he might haue hir to wife: to whome answer was made, that he might haue his daughter, but as for anie dower he could haue none, for all was promised and assured to hir other sisters alreadie. Aganippus notwithstanding this answer of deniall to receiue anie thing by way of dower with Cordeilla, tooke hir to wife, onlie moued thereto (I saie) for respect of hir person and amiable vertues. This Aganippus was one of the twelue kings that ruled Gallia in those daies, as in the British historie it is recorded. But to proceed.</p>

<note place="marg">He gouerned the third part of Gallia as <emph>Gal. Mon.</emph> saith.</note>

<p>After that Leir was fallen into age, the two dukes that had married his two eldest daughters, thinking it long yer the gouernment of the land did come to their hands, arose against him in armour, and reft from him the gouernance of the land, vpon conditions to be continued for terme of life: by the which he was put to his portion, that is, to liue after a rate assigned to him for the maintenance of his estate, which in processe of time was diminished as well by Maglanus as by Henninus. But the greatest griefe that Leir tooke, was to see the vnkindnesse of his daughters, which seemed to thinke that all was too much which their father had, the same being neuer so little: in so much that going from the one to the other, he was brought to that miserie, that scarslie they would allow him one seruant to wait vpon him.</p>
<p>In the end, such was the vnkindnesse, or (as I maie saie) the vnnaturalnesse which he found in his two daughters, notwithstanding their faire and pleasant words vttered in time past, that being constreined of necessitie, he fled the land, *entity* sailed into Gallia, there to seeke some comfort of his yongest daughter Cordeilla, whom before time he hated. The ladie Cordeilla hearing that he was arriued in poore estate, she first sent to him priuilie a certeine summe of monie to apparell himsalfe withall, and to reteine a certeine number of seruants that might attend vpon him in honorable wise, as apperteined to the estate which he had borne: and then so accompanied, she appointed him to come to the court, which he did, and was so ioifullie, honorablie, and louinglie receiued, both by his sonne in law Aganippus, and also by his daughter Cordeilla, that his hart was greatlie comforted: for he was no lesse honored, than if he had beene king of the whole countrie himselfe.</p>

<pb n="448"/>
<p>Now when he had informed his sonne in law and his daughter in what sort he had b*entity*ene vsed by his other daughters, Aganippus caused a mightie armie to be put in a readinesse, and likewise a great nauie of ships to be rigged, to passe ouer into Britaine with Leir his father in law, to s*entity*e him againe restored to his kingdome. It was accorded, that Cordeilla should also go with him to take possession of the land, the which he promised to leaue vnto hir, as the rightfull inheritour after his decesse, notwithstanding any former grant made to hir sisters or to their husbands in anie maner of wise.</p>
<p>Herevpon, when this armie and nauie of ships were readie, Leir and his daughter Cordeilla with hir husband tooke the sea, and arriuing in Britaine, fought with their enimies, and discomfited them in battell, in the which Maglanus and Henninus were slaine: and then was Leir restored to his kingdome, which he ruled after this by the space of two y*entity*eres,

 writers) tooke an end: for after the death of the two foresaid brethren, no rightfull inheritor was left aliue to succ*entity*ed them in the kingdome. The names of these fiue kings are found in certeine old pedegr*entity*es: and although the same be much corrupted in diuers copies, yet these vndernamed are the most agr*entity*eable.</p>
<p>But of these fiue kings or dukes, the English chronicle alloweth Cloton king of Cornewall for most rightfull heire. There appeareth not any time certeine by report of ancient 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph> Ciuill warres 51. yeares.</note>

 authors, how long this variance continued amongst the Britains: but (as some say) it lasted for the space of 51 yeres, coniecturing so much by that which is recorded in Polychron. who saith, who it endured euen till the beginning of the reigne of Mulmucius Dunwallon, who began to gouerne from the time that Brute first entred Britaine, about the space of 703 thr*entity*e yeares.</p>
<p>*entity* Here ye must note, that there is difference amongst writers about the supputation and account of these yeares, insomuch that some making their reckoning after certeine writers, and finding the same to varie aboue thr*entity*e C. yeares, are brought into further doubt of the truth of the whole historie: but whereas other haue by diligent search tried out the continuance of euerie gouernors reigne, and reduced the same to a likelihood of some conformitie, I haue thought best to follow the same, leauing the credit thereof with the first authors.</p>

<p>NOW to proceede with the aforesaid authors, Mulmucius Dunwall*entity*, or as other sale 

<note place="marg">MULMUCIUS. <emph>Matth. West. Polyd.</emph></note>

 Dunuallo Mulmucius, the sonne of Cloton (as testifieth th'english chronicle and also Geffrey of Monmouth) got the vpper hand of the other dukes or rulers: and after his fathers deceasse began his reigne ouer the whole monarchie of Britaine, in the y*entity*ere of the world 3529, after the building of Rome 314, and after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of captiuitie 97, and about the 26 y*entity*ere of Darius Artaxerxes Longimanus, the fift king of the Persians. This Mulmucius Dunuallo is named in the english chronicle Donebant, and prooued a right worthie prince. He builded within the citie of London then called Troinouant, a temple, and named it the temple of peace: the which (as some hold opinion, I wote 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph> See more in the description.</note>

 not vpon what ground) was the same which now is called Blackwell hall, where the market for buieng and selling of cloths is kept. The chronicle of England affirmeth, that Mulmucius 

<note place="marg">Malmesburie and the Vies built. <emph>Matth. West.</emph> Lawes made.</note>

 (whome the old booke nameth Molle) builded the to townes Malmesburie and the Vies. He also made manie good lawes, which were long after vsed, called Mulmucius lawes, turned out of the British sp*entity*ech into the Latine by Gildas Priscus, and long time after translated out of latine into english by Alfred king of England, and mingled in his statutes. He moreouer gaue priuileges to temples, to plowes, to cities, and to high waies leading to the same, so that whosoeuer fled to them, should be in safegard from bodilie harme, and from thence he might depart into what countrie he would, with indemnitie of his person. Some 

<note place="marg"><emph>Caxton</emph> and <emph>Polychron.</emph></note>

 authors write, that he began to make the foure great high waies of Britaine, the which were finished by his sonne Blinus, as after shall be declared.</p>
<p>After he had established his land, and set his Britains in good and conuenient order, he 

<note place="marg">The first king that was crowned with a golden crowne.</note>

 ordeined him by the aduise of his lords a crowne of gold, *entity* caused himselfe with great solemnitie to be crowned, according to the custome of the pagan lawes then in vse: *entity* bicause he was the first that bare a crowne h*entity*ere in Britaine, after the opinion of some writers, he is named the first king of Britaine, and all the other before rehearsed are named rulers, dukes, or gouernors.</p>
<p>Amongst other of his ordinances, he appointed weights and measures, with the which 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polyd.</emph> Weights and measures. Theft punished <emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 men should buy and sell. And further he deuised sore and streight orders for the punishing of theft. Finallie, after he had guided the land by the space of fortie y*entity*eres, he died, and was buried in the foresaid temple of peace which he had erected within the citie of Troinouant <pb n="452"/>now called London, as before ye haue heard, appointing in his life time, that his kingdome should be diuided. betwixt his two sonnes, Brennus and Belinus (as some, men doo coniecture.)</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polyd.</emph> saith 5.</note>

 with this partition were they contented by the tearme of six or seuen y*entity*eres, after which 

<note place="marg">Brennus not content with his portion.</note>

 time expired, Brennus coueting to haue more than his portion came to, first thought to purchase himselfe aid in forreine parties, *entity* therefore by the prouocation and counsell of yong 

<note place="marg">Elsingius.</note>

 vnquiet heads, sailed ouer into Norway, and there married the daughter of Elsung or Elsing, as then duke or ruler of that countries Beline offended with his brother, that he should thus without his aduice marrie with a stranger, now in his absence seized all his lands, townes, and fortresses into his owne hands, placing garisons of men of warre where he thought conuenient.</p>
<p>In the meane time, Brenne aduertised hereof, assembled a great nauie of ships, well furnished with people and souldiers of the Norwegians, with the which he tooke his course 

<note place="marg">Guilthdacus king of Denmarke.</note>

 homewards, but in the waie he was encountred by Guilthdacus king of Denmarke, the which had laid long in wait for him, bicause of the yoong ladie which Brenne had maried, for whome he had b*entity*ene a sutor to hir father Elsing of long time. When these two fl*entity*etes of the Danes and Norwegians met, there was a sore battell betwixt them, but finallie the Danes ouercame them of Norway, and tooke the ship wherein the new bride was conueied, and then was she brought aboord the ship of Guilthdacus. Brenne escaped by flight as well as he might. But when Guilthdacus had thus obtained the victorie and prey, suddenlie therevpon 

<note place="marg">A tempest.</note>

 arose a sore tempest of wind and weather, which scattered the Danish fleete, and put the king in danger to haue b*entity*ene lost: but finallie within flue daies after, being driuen by 

<note place="marg">Guilthdacus landed in the north.</note>

 force of wind, h*entity* landed in Northumberland, with a few such ships as kept togither with him.</p>
<p>Beline being then in that countrie, prouiding for defense against his brother, vpon knowledge of the king of Denmarks arriuall, caused him to be staied. Shortlie after, Brenne hauing recouered and gotten togither the most part of his ships that were dispersed by the discomfiture, and then newlie rigged and furnished of all things necessarie, sent word to his brother Beline, both to restore vnto him his wife wrongfullie rauished by Guilthdacus, and also his lands iniuriouslie by him seized into his possession. These requests being plainlie and shortlie denied, Brenne made no long delaie, but sp*entity*edilie made toward Albania, and landing with his armie in a part thereof, incountred with his brother Beline n*entity*ere vnto a wood named 

<note place="marg">Calater wood is in Scotland.</note>

 as then Calater, where (after cruell fight, and mortall battell betwixt them) at length the victorie abode with the Britains, and the discomfiture did light so on the Norwegians, that the most of them were wounded, claine, and left dead vpon the ground.</p>
<p>Hereby Brenne being forced to fl*entity*e, made shift, and got ouer into Gallia, where after he 

<note place="marg">Segmnus or seginus duke of the Allobrogs, now the Delphinat or Sauoy.</note>

 had sued to this prince, at length he abode, and was well receiued of one Seguinus or Seginus duke of the people called then Allobrogs (as Galfrid of Monmouth saith) or rather Armorica, which now is called Britaine, as Polychronicon, and the english historic printed by Caxton, more trulie maie seeme to affirme. But Beline hauing got the vpper hand of his enimies, assembling his councell at Caerbranke, now called York, tooke aduise what he <pb n="453"/>should doo with the king of Denmarke: where it was ordeined, that he should be set at libertie, with condition and vnder couenant, to acknowledge himselfe by dooing homage, to hold his land of the king of Britaine, and to paie him a y*entity*erelie tribute. These couenants 

<note place="marg">The Danes tributarie to the Britains.</note>

 being agr*entity*ed vpon, and hostages taken for assurance, he was set at libertie, and so returned into his countrie. The tribute that he couenanted to paie, was a thousand pounds, as the English chronicle saith.</p>
<p>When Beline had thus expelled his brother, and was alone possessed of all the land of Britaine, he first confirmed the lawes made by his father: and for so much as the foure 

<note place="marg">The foure high waies finished.</note>

 waies begun by his father were not brought to perfection, he therefore caused workmen to be called foorth and assembled, whom he set in hand to paue the said waies with stone, for the better passage and ease of all that should trauell through the countries from place to place, as occasion should require.</p>
<p>The first of these foure waies is named Fosse, and stretcheth from the south into the north, 

<note place="marg">The Fosse.</note>

 beginning at the corner of Totnesse in Cornewall, and so passing foorth by Deuonshire, and Somersetshire, by Tutherie, on Cotteswold, and then forward beside Couentrie vnto Leicester, and from thence by wild plaines towards Newarke, and endeth at the citie of Lin colne. The second waie was named Watling str*entity*ete, the which stretcheth ouerthwart the 

<note place="marg">Watling Street.</note>

 Fosse, out of the southeast into the northeast, beginning at Douer, and passing by the middle of Kent ouer Thames beside London, by-west of Westminster, as some haue thought, and so foorth by S. Albons, and by the west side of Dunstable, Stratford, Toucester, and Wedon by-south of Lilleborne, by Atherston, Gilberts hill, that now is called the Wreken, and so foorth by Seuerne, passing beside Worcester, vnto Stratton to the middle of Wales, and so vnto a place called Cardigan, at the Irish sea. The third way was named Ermingstr*entity*et, which stretched out of the west northwest, vnto the east southeast, 

<note place="marg">Erming str*entity*et.</note>

 and beginneth at Meneuia, the which is in Saint Dauids land in west Wales, and so vnto Southampton. The fourth and last waie hight Hiknelstr*entity*ete, which leadeth by 

<note place="marg">Hiknelstr*entity*et.</note>

 Worcester, Winchcombe, Birmingham, Lichfield, Darbie, Chesterfield, and by Yorke, and so foorth vnto Tinmouth. After he had caused these waies to be well and sufficientlie raised

 and made, he confirmed vnto them all such priuileges as were granted by his father.</p>

<head type="unitnum">The Third Chapter.</head>

<p>IN the meane time that Beline was thus occupied about the necessarie affaires of his realme and kingdome, his brother Brenne that was fled into Gallia onelie with 12. persons, bicause he was a goodlie gentleman, and s*entity*emed to vnderstand what apperteined to honour, grew shortlie into fauour with Seginus the duke afore mentioned, and declaring vnto him his aduersitie, and the whole circumstance of his mishap, at length was so highlie cherished of the said Seginus, deliting in such worthie qualities as he saw in him dailie appearing, that he gaue to him his daughter in manage. with condition, that if he died without issue male

 then should he inherit his estate *entity* dukedome: and if it happened him to leaue anie heire male behind him, then should he yet helpe him to recouer his land and dominion in Britaine, b*entity*ereft from him by his brother.</p>
<p>These conditions well and surelie vpon the dukes part by the assent of the nobles of his land concluded, ratified, and assured, the said duke within the space of one y*entity*ere after died. And then after a certeine time, being knowne that the duches was not with child, all the lords of that countrie did homage to Brenne, receiuing him as their lord and supreme <pb n="454"/>gouernour, vpon whome he likewise for his part in recompense of their curtesie, bestowed a great portion of his treasure.</p>

<note place="marg">Brenne with an armiereturneth into Britaine.</note>

<p>Shortlie after also, with their assent he gathered an armie, and with the same eftsoones came ouer into Britaine, to make new warre vpon his brother Beline. Of whose landing when Beline was informed, he assembled his people, and made himselfe readie to m*entity*ete 

<note place="marg">Brenne and Beline made fiends by intercession of their mother.</note>

 him: but as they were at point to haue ioined battell, by the intercession of their mother that came betwixt them, and demeaned hirselfe in all motherlie order, and most louing maner towards them both, they fell to an agr*entity*ement, and were made friends or euer they parted asunder.</p>
<p>After this they repaired to London, and there taking aduice togither with their peeres and councellors, for the good order and quieting of the land, at length they accorded to passe with both their armies into Gallia, to subdue that whole countrie, and so following this determination, they tooke shipping and sailed ouer into Gallia, where beginning the warre with fire and sword, they wrought such maisreries, that within a short time (as saith Geffrey of 

<note place="marg">They inuade Gallia and Italie.</note>

 Monmouth) they conquered a great part of Gallia, Italie, and Germanie, and brought it to their subiection. In the end they tooke Rome by this occasion (as writers report) if these be the same that had the leading of those Galles, which in this season did so much hurt in italie and other parts of the world.</p>
<p>After they had passed the mountaines, *entity* were entred into Tuscan, they besieged the citie 

<note place="marg">Now Clusi.</note>

 of Clusium, the citizens whereof being in great danger, sent to Rome for aid against their enimies. Wherevpon the Romanes, considering with themselues that although they were not in anie league of societie with the Clusians, yet if they were ouercome the danger of the next 

<note place="marg">Ambassadours sent from Rome. Brennus answere.</note>

 brunt were like to be theirs: with all sp*entity*ed they sent ambassadours to intreat betwixt the parties for some peace to be had.</p>
<p>They that were sent, required the capteines of the Galles, in the name of the senat and citizens of Rome, not to molest the friends of the Romans. Wherevnto answere was made by Brennus, that for his part he could be content to haue peace, if it were so that the Clusians would be agr*entity*eable that the Galles might haue part of the countrie which they held, being more than they did alreadie well occupies for otherwise (said he) there could be no peace granted.</p>
<p>The Romane ambassadours being offended with these wordes, demanded what the Galles had to doo in Tuscan, by reason of which and other the like ouerthwart wordes, the parties 

<note place="marg">The treatie of peace breaketh off.</note>

 began to kindle in displeasure so farre, that their communication brake off, and so they from treating fell againe to trie the matter by dint of sword.</p>
<p>The Romane ambassadours also to shew of what prowesse the Romans were, contrarie to the law of nations (forbidding such as came in ambassage about anie treatie of peace to take either one part or other) tooke weapon in hand, and ioined themselues with the Clusians, wherewith the Galles were so much displeased, that incontinentlie with one voice, they required to haue the siege raised from Clusium, that they might go to Rome. But Brennus thought good first to send messengers thither, to require the deliuerie of such as had broken the law, that punishment might be done on them accordinglie as they had deserued. This was done, and knowledge brought againe, that the ambassadors were not onelie not punished, but also chosen to be tribunes for the next yeare.</p>
<p>The Galles The Galles then became in such a rage (because they saw there was nothing to be looked 

<note place="marg">The Galles make towards Rome. The Romans incountring with the Galles are ouerthrowne.</note>

 for at the hands of the Romans, but warre, iniurious wrongs, and deceitfull traines) that they turned all their force against them, marching streight towardes Rome, and by the waie destroied all that stood before them. The Romans aduertised thereof, assembled themselues togither to the number of 40. thousand, and encountring with Beline and Brenne, neare to the riuer Allia, about H. miles on this side Rome, were slaine and quite discomfited.</p>
<p>The Galles could scarse bel*entity*eue that they had got the victorie with so small resistance: but when they perceiued that the Romans were quite ouerthrowne and that the field was clearelie rid of them, they got togither the spoile, and made towards Rome it selfe, where <pb n="455"/>such feare and terror was striken into the heartes of the people, that all men were in despaire 

<note place="marg">The Romans in despaire tiwhdraw into the capitoll.</note>

 to defend the citie: and therefore the senate with all the warlike youth of the citizens got them into the capitoll, which they furnished with victuals and all things necessarie for the maintenance of the same against a long siege. The honorable fathers and all the multitude of other people not apt for warres, remained still in the citie, as it were to perish with their countrie if hap so befell.</p>
<p>In the meane time came the Galles to the citie, and entring by the gate Collina, they 

<note place="marg">The Galles enter into Rome.</note>

 passed forth the right way vnto the market place, maruelling to s*entity*e the houses of the poorer sort to be shut against them, and those of the richer to remaine wide open; wherefore being doubtfull of some deceitfull traines, they were not ouer rash to enter the same; but after they had espied the ancient fathers sit in their chaires apparelled in their rich robes, as 

<note place="marg">The reuerend aspect of the senators.</note>

 if they had bin in the senat, they reuerenced them as gods, so honorable was their port, graunesse in countenance, and shew of apparell.</p>
<p>In the meane time it chanced, that Marcus Papirius stroke one of the Galles on the head 

<note place="marg"><emph>Marcus Papirius.</emph></note>

 with his staffe, because he presumed to stroke his beard: with which iniurie the Gall being prouoked, slue Papirius (as he sat) with his sword, and therewith the slaughter being begun with one, all the residue of those ancient fatherlie men as they sat in their chaires were slaine and cruellie murthered. After this all the people found in the citie without respect or difference at all, were put to the sword, and their houses sacked. And thus was Rome 

<note place="marg">Rome sacked.</note>

 taken by the two brethren, Beline and Brenne, 365 yeares after the first building thereof. 

<note place="marg"><date>365.</date></note>

 Besides this, the Galles attempted in the night season to haue entred the capitoll: and in d*entity*ed ordered their enterprise so secretlie, that they had atchieued their purpose, if a sort of 

<note place="marg">The capitoll defended.</note>

 ganders had not with their crie and noise disclosed them, in wakening the Romans that were asl*entity*epe: *entity* so by that meanes were the Galles beaten backe and repelled.</p>

<head type="unitnum">The Fourth Chapter.</head>

<p>THE Romans being thus put to their extreame shift, deuised among themselues how to reuoke Furius Camillus from exile, whom not long before they had vniustlie banished out of the citie. In the end they did not onelie send for him home, but also created him dictator, committing into his handes (so long as his office lasted) an absolute power ouer all men, both of life and death. Camillus forgetfull of the iniurie done to him, and mindfull of his dutie towards his countries and lamenting the state thereof, without delay gathered such an armie as the present time permitted.</p>
<p>In the meane time those that kept the capitoll (being almost famished for lacke of vittels) compounded with Brenne and Beline, that for a thousand pounds weight in gold, the 

<note place="marg">A composition.</note>

 Romans should red*entity*eme their liberties, and the said Brenne and Beline depart with their armie out of the citie and all the territories of Rome. But at the deliuerie of the monie, and by a certeine kind of hap, the Romans name was preserued at that time from such dishonor and ignominie as was likelie to haue insued. For some of the couetous sort of the Galles, not contented with the iust weight of the gold, did cast their swords also into the balance where the weights lay, thereby to haue ouer weight: wherevpon the Romans refused to make paiment after that weight.</p>
<p>And thus whilest they were in altercation about this matter, the one importunnate to haue, the other not willing to grant, the time passed, till in the meane season Camillus came in 

<note place="marg">Camillus disappointeth the Galles of their paiment.</note>

 amongst them with his power, commanding that the gold should be had away, and affirming <pb n="456"/>that without consent of the dictator, no composition or agr*entity*ement might be concluded by the meaner magistrate. He gaue a signe to the Galles to prepare themselues to battell 

<note place="marg">The Galles onerthrowne.</note>

 whervnto they lightlie agr*entity*ed, and togither they went. The battell being once begun, the Galles that looked earst for gold, and not for battell, were easilie ouercome, such as stood to the brunt were slaine, and the rest by flight constreined to depart the citie.</p>
<p>Polybius writeth, that the Galles were turned from the siege of the citie, through wars which chanced amongst their owne people at home, and therefore they concluded a peace with the Romans, and leauing them in libertie returned home againe.</p>
<p>But howsoeuer the matter passed, thus much haue we stept from our purpose, to shew somwhat of that noble and most famous capteine Brennus, who (as not onelie our histories, but also Giouan Villani the Florentine dooth report) was a Britaine, and brother to Beline (as before is mentioned) although I know that manie other writers are not of that mind, affirming him to be a Gall, and likewise that after this present time of the taking of Rome by this Brennus 110 yeares, or there abouts, there was another Brennus a Gall by nation (say they) vuder whose conduct an other armie of the Gals inuaded Grecia, which Brennus had a brother that hight Belgius, although Humfrey Llhoyd and sir Iohn Prise doo flatlie denie the same, by reason of some discordance in writers, *entity* namelie in the computation of the yeares set downe by them that haue recorded the dooings of those times, whereof the error is growen. Howbeit I doubt not but that the truth of this matter shall be more fullie sifted out in time by the learned and studious of such antiquities. But now to our purpose.</p>
<p>This is also to be noted, that where our histories make mention, that Bleine was abroad with Brennus in the most part of his victories, both in Gallia, Germanie, and Italie; Titus 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ttius Liu. Polydor.</emph></note>

 Liuius speaketh but onlie of Brennus: wherevpon some write, that after the two brethren were by their mothers intreatance made friends, Brennus onlie went ouer to Gallia, and there through proofe of his woorthie prowesse, atteined to such estimation amongst the people called Galli Senones, that he was chosen to be their generall capteine at their going ouer 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth West.</emph></note>

 the mountaines into Italie. But whether Beline went ouer with his brother, and finallie returned backe againe, leauing Brennus behind him, as some write, or that he went not at all, but remained still at home whilest his brother was abroad, we can affirme no certeintie.</p>
<p>Most part of all our writers make report of manie woorthie deeds accomplished by Beline, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychr. Gal. M.</emph></note>

 in repairing of cities decaied, *entity* erecting of other new buildings, to the adorning and 

<note place="marg">Caerleon Wiske built by Beline.</note>

 beautifieng of his realme and kingdome. And amongst other works which were by him built by Beline. erected, he builded a citie in the south part of Wales, neare to the place where the riuer of Vske falleth into Seuerne, fast by Glamorgan, which cite hight Caerleon, or Caerlegion Ar Wiske. This Caerleon was the principall citie in time past of all Demetia, now called South wales. Manie notable monuments are remaining there till this day, testifieng the great magnificence and roiall buildings of that citie in old time. In which citie also sith the time of Christ were thr*entity*e churches, one of saint Iulius the martyr, an other of saint Aron, and the third was the mother church of all Demetia, and the chiefe s*entity*e: but after, the same s*entity*e was translated vnto Meneuia, (that is to say) saint Dauid in Westwales. In this Caerleon was Amphibulus borne, who taught and instructed saint Albon.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

<p>This Beline also builded an hauen, with a gate ouer the same, within the citie of Troinouant now called London, in the summitie or highest part wherof afterwards was set a vessell of brasse, in the which were put the ashes of his bodie, which bodie after his deceasse was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Leland.</emph></note>

 burnt as the maner of burieng in those daies did require. This gate was long after called Belins gate, and at length by corruption of language Billings gate. He builded also a castell eastward from this gate (as some haue written) which was long time after likewise called 

<note place="marg">The tower of London built by Beline.</note>

 Belins castell, and is the same which now we call the tower of London. Thus Beline studieng dailie to beautifie this land with goodlie buildings and famous workes, at length departed this life, after he had reigned with his brother iointlie and alone the space of 26 yeres.</p>

This Gurguint in the English chronicle is named Corinbratus, and by Matthew Westmin. he is surnamed Barbiruc, the which bicause

<p>After he had thus atchiued his desire in Denmarke, as he returned backe towards Britaine, he encountred with a nauie of 30 ships beside the Iles of Orkenies. These ships were fraught with men and women, and had to their capteine one called Bartholin or Partholin, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West. Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 who being brought to the presence of king Gurguint, declared that he with his people were banished out of Spaine, and were named Balenses or Baselenses, and had sailed long on the 

<note place="marg">Basques.</note>

 sea, to the end to find some prince that would assigne them a place to inhabit, to whom 

<note place="marg">s*entity*em more hereof in Ireland.</note>

 they would become subiects, *entity* hold of him as of their souereigne gouernor. Therefore he besought the king to consider their estate, and of his great benignitie to appoint some void quarter where they might settle. The king with the aduice of his barons granted to them the Ile of Ireland, which as then (by report of some authors) lay waste and without habitation. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychron.</emph></note>

 But it should appeare by other writers, that it was inhabited long before those daies, by the people called Hibernenses, of Hiberus their capteine that brought them also out of Spaine.</p>
<p>After that Gurguintus was returned into his countrie, he ordeined that the laws made by his ancestors should be dulie kept and obserued, And thus administring Justice to his subiects for the tearme of 19 yeares, he finallie departed this life, and was buried at London, or as some haue at Caerleon. In his daies was the towne of Cambridge with the

He had also a wife named Martia, a woman of perfect beauties *entity* wisedome incomparable, as by hir prudent gouernement and equall administration of iustice after hir husbands deceasse, during hir sonnes minoritie, it most manifestlie appeared.</p>
<p>It is thought that in an happie time this Guintoline came to the gouernement of this kingdome, being shaken and brought out of order with ciuill dissentions, to the end he might reduce it to the former estate, which he earnestlie accomplished: for hauing once got the place, he studied with great diligence to reforme anew, and to adorne with justice, lawes and good orders, the British common wealth, by other kings not so framed as stood wi h the quietnesse thereof. But afore all things he vtterlie remooued and appeased such ciuill discord, as s*entity*emed yet to remaine after the maner of a remnant of those seditious factions and partakings, which had so long time reigned in this land. But as he was busie in hand herewith, death tooke him out of this life, after he had reigned 27 yeares, and then was he buried at London.</p>

<note place="marg">Queene Martia gouerneth in hir sonnes roome.</note>

 By reason that Sicilius was not of age sufficient of himselfe to guide the kingdome of the Britams, his mother that worthie ladie called Martia, had the gouernance both of his realme and person committed to hir charge.</p>

<note place="marg">ELANIUS.</note>

<p>ELANIUS the sonne of Kimarus, or (as other haue) his brother, began to rule the Britaines in the yeare after the creation of the world 3361, after the building of Rome 445, after 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 the deliuerance of the Israelites 229, and in the fourth yeare of the Seleuciens, after which account the bookes of Machabees doo reckon, which began in the 14, after the death of Alexander. This Elanius in the English Chronicle is named also Haran; by Mat. Westm. Danius; and by an old chronicle which Fabian much followed, Elanius and Kimarus should seeme to be one person: but other hold the contrarie, and saie that he reigned fullie 8. yeares.</p>

<note place="marg">MORINDUS.</note>

<p>MORINDUS the bastard sonne of Elanius was admitted king of Britaine, in the yeare of the world 3667, after the building of Rome 451, after the deliuerance of the Israelites 236, and in the tenth yeare of Cassander K. of Macedonia, which hauing dispatched Olimpias the mother of Alexander the great, and gotten Roxanes with Alexanders sonne into his hands, vsurped the kingdome of the Macedonians, and held it 15 y*entity*eres. This Morindus in the English chronicle is called Morwith, and was a man of worthie fame in chiualrie and martiall dooings, but so cruell withall, that his vnmercifull nature could scarse be satisfied with the torments of them that had offended him, although oftentimes with his owne hands he cruellie put them to torture and execution. He was also beautifull and coinelie of personage, liberall and bounteous, and of a maruellous strength.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>C. Mon.</emph></note>

<p>In his daies, a certeine king of the people called Moriani, with a great armie landed in Northumberland, and began to make cruell warre vpon the inhabitants. But Morindus <pb n="459"/>aduertised h*entity*erof, assembled his Britains, came against the enimies, and in battell putting them to flight, chased them to their ships, and tooke a great number of them prisoners, whome to the satisfieng of his cruell nature he caused to be slaine euen in his presence. Some of them were headed, some strangled, some panched, and some he caused to be slaine quicke.</p>

<p>But now to end with Morindus.

 Britain, in the y*entity*ere of the world 3676, after the building of Rome 461, and fourth y*entity*ere of the 121. Olimpiad. This Gorbonianus in the English chronicle is named Granbodian, and was a righteous prince in his gouernment, and verie deuout (according to such deuotion 

<note place="marg">A righteous and religious prince.</note>

 as he had) towards the aduancing of the religion of his gods: and thervpon he repaired all the old temples through his kingdome, and erected some new.</p>
<p>He also builded the townes of Cambridge and Grantham (as Caxton writeth) and was beloued both of the rich and poore, for he honoured the rich, and relieued the poore in time of their necessities. In his time was more plentie of all things necessarie for the wealthfull state of man, than had b*entity*ene before in anie of his predecessors daies. He died without issue, after he had reigned (by the accord of most writers) about the were terme of ten yeares.</p>
<p>Some write that this Gorbonian built the townes of Cairgrant, now called Cambridge, *entity* 

<note place="marg">Cambridge by whome it was built.</note>

 also Grantham, but some with that those which haue so written are deceiued in mistaking the name; for that Cambridge was at the first called Granta: and by that meanes it might be that Gorbonian built onlie Grantham, and not Cambridge, namelie because other write how that Cambridge (as before is said) was built in the daies of Gurguntius the sonne of Beline, by one Cantaber a Spaniard, brother to Partholoin, which Partholoin by the aduice of the same Gurguntius, got seates for himselfe and his companie in Ireland (as before ye haue heard.)</p>
<p>The said Cantaber also obteining licence of Gurguntius, builded a towne vpon the side of the riuer called Canta, which he closed with walles, and fortified with a strong tower or castell, and after procuring philosophers to come hither from Athens (where in his youth he had bene a student) he placed them there, and so euen then was that place furnished (as they sale) with learned men, and such as were readie to instruct others in knowledge of letters and philosophicall doctrine. But by whome or in what time soeuer it was built, certeine it is that there was a citie or towne walled in that place before the comming of the Saxons, called by the Britaines Caergrant, and by the Saxons Granchester.</p>
<p>This towne fell so to ruine by the inuasion of the Saxons, that at length it was in maner <pb n="460"/>left desolate, a;id at this day remaineth as a village. But n*entity*ere therevnto vnder the Saxon kings, an other towne was built, now called Cambridge, where by the fauour of king Sigebert and Felix a Burgundian, that was bishop of Dunwich, a schoole was erected, as in place conuenient shall appeare.</p>

<note place="marg">ARCHIGALLUS.</note>

<p>ARCHIGALLUS, the second sonne of Morindus, and brother vnto Gorbonianus, was admitted king of Britaine, in the yeare 8686, after the building of the citie of Rome 470, after the deliuerance of the Israelites out of captiuitie 255, and in the first yeare of Sosthenes king of Macedonia. This Archigallus (in the English chronicle called Artogaill) followed not the 

<note place="marg">He is giuen to nourish dissention.</note>

 steppes of his brother, but gluing himselfe to dissention and strife, imagined causes against his nobles, that he might displace them, and set such in their roomes as were men of base birth and of euill conditions. Also he sought by vnlawfull meanes to bereaue his wealthie subiects of their goods and riches, so to inrich himselfe and impouerish his people. For the which his inordinate dooings, his nobles conspired against him, and finallie depriued him of all his honor and kinglie dignitie, after he had reigned about the space of one yeare.</p>

<note place="marg">ELIDURUS.</note>

<p>ELIDURUS the third sonne of Morindus, and brother to Archigallus, was by one consent of the Britains chosen to reigne ouer them in his brothers stead, after the creation of the world 3687, and after the building of the citie of Rome 471, after the deliuerance of the Israelites 256, *entity* in the first yeare of Sosthenes king of Macedonia. This Elidurus in the English chronicle named Hesider, or Esoder, prooued a most righteous prince, and doubting least he should doo otherwise than became him, if he did not take care for his brother Archigallus estate, a man might woonder what diligence he shewed in trauelling with the nobles of the realme to haue his brother restored to the crowne againe.</p>
<p>Now as it chanced one day (being abroad on hunting in the wood called Calater) neare vnto Yorke, he found his. brother Archigall wandering there in the thickes: of that wildernesse, 

<note place="marg">By this it should s*entity*eme that Acliud should not be in Scotland, contrarie to the Scotish authors.</note>

 whom in most iouing maner he secretlie conueied home to his house, being as then in the citie of Aldud, otherwise called Acliud. Shortlie after he feined himselfe sicke, and in all hast sent messengers about to assemble his barons, who being come at the day appointed, he called them one after another into his priuie chamber, and there handled them in such affectuous sort with wise and discr*entity*et words, that he got their good wils to further him to their powers, for the reducing of the kingdome eftsoones into the hands of his brother Archigallus.</p>
<p>After this he assembled a councell at Yorke, where he so vsed the matter with the commons, that in conclusion, when the said Elidurus had gouerned the land well and honourablie the space of thr*entity*e yeares, he resigned wholie his crowne and kinglie title vnto his brother Archigallo, who was receiued of the Britaines againe as king by mediation of his

<note place="marg">ARCHIGALLUS AGAIN.</note>

<p>WHEN Archigallus was thus restored to the kingdome, and hauing learned by due correction that he must turne the leafe, and take out a new lesson, by changing his former trade of liuing into better, if he would reigne in suertie: he became a new man, vsing himselfe vprightlie in the administration of iustice, and behauing himselfe so woorthilie in all his doings, both toward the nobles *entity* commons of his realme, that he was both beloued and dread of all his subiects. And so continuing the whole tearme of his life, finallie departed <pb n="461"/>out of this world after he had reigned this second time the space of ten yeares, and was buried at Yorke.</p>
<p>ELIDURUS brother to this Archigallus was then againe admitted king by consent of all the

But his two yonger brethren, Vigenius and Peredurus, enuieng the happie state of this woorthie prince, so highlie for his vertue and good gouernance esteemed of the Britains, of a grounded malice conspired against him, and assembling an armie, leuied warre against him, and in a pitcht field tooke him prisoner, and put him in the

These two brethren in the English chronicles are named Higanius and Petitur, who (as Gal.

<p>But Gal.

<p>HERE is to be noted, that euen from the beginning of the British kings, which reigned here in this land, there is great diuersitie amongest writers, both touching the names, and also the times of their reignes, speciallie till they come to the death of the last mentioned king Elidurus. Insomuch that Polydor Virgil in his historie of England, finding a 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor</emph></note>

 manifest error as he taketh it) in those writers whome he followeth touching the account, from the comming of Brute, vnto the sacking of Rome by Brennus, whome our histories affirme to be the brother of Beline, that to fill vp the number which is wanting in the reckoning of the yeares of those kings which reigned after Brute, till the daies of the same Brenne *entity* Beline, he thought good to change the order, least one error should follow an other, and so of one error making manie, he hath placed those kings which after other <pb n="462"/>writers should s*entity*eme to follow Brenne and Beline, betwixt Dunuallo and Mulmucius, father to the said Beline and Brenne, and those fiue kings which stroue for the gouernemnent after the deceasse of the two brethren, Ferrex and Porrex, putting Guintoline to succ*entity*ed after the fiue kings or rulers, and after Guintoline his wife Martia, during the minoritie of hir sonne, then hir said sonne named Sicilius.</p>
<p>After him succ*entity*eded these whose names follow in order, Chimarius, Danius, M4orindus, Gorbonianus, Archigallo, who being deposed, Elidurus was made king, and so continued till he restored the gouernement (as ye haue heard) to Archigallo againe, and after his death Elidurus was eftsoones admitted, and within awhile againe deposed by Vigenius and Peredurus, and after their deceasses the third time restored. Then after his deceasse followed successiuelie Veginus, Morganus, Ennanus, Idunallo, Rimo, Geruntius, Catellus, Coilus, Porrex the second of that name, Cherinus, Fulgentius, Eldalus, Androgeus, Vrianus and Eliud, after whom should follow Dunuallo Molmucius, as in his proper place, if the order of things doone, *entity* the course of time should be obserued, as Polydor gathereth by the account of yeares attributed to those kings that reigned before and after Dunuallo, according to those authours whom (as I said) he followeth, if they will that Brennus which led the Galles to Rome be the same that was sonne to the said Dunuallo Mulmucius, and brother to Beline.</p>
<p>But sith other haue in better order brought out a perfect agr*entity*ement in the account of yeares, and succession of those kings, which reigned and gouerned in this land before the sacking of Rome; and also another such as it is after the same, and before the Romans had anie perfect knowledge thereof; we haue thought good to follow them therein, leauing to euerie man his libertie to iudge as his knowledge shall serue him in a thing so doubtfull and vncerteine, by reason of variance amongst the ancient writers in that behalfe.</p>
<p>And euen as there is great difference in writers since Gurguintus, till the death of Elidurus, so is there as great or rather greater after his deceasse, speciallie till king Lud 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 atteined the kingdome. But as maie be gathered by that which Fabian and other whome he followeth doo write, there passed abQue 185 yeares betwixt the last yeare of Elidurus, and the beginning of king Lud his reigne, in the which time there reigned 32, or 33, kings, as some writers haue mentioned, whose names (as Gal. Mon. hath recorded) are these immediatlie h*entity*ere named; Regnie the, sonne of Gorbolian or Gorbonlian, a worthie prince, who iustlie and mercifullie gouerned his people; Margan the sonne of Archigallo a noble prince likewise, and guiding his subiects in good quiet; Emerian brother to the same Margan, hut far vnlike to him in maners, so that he was deposed in the sixt yeare of his reigne; Ydwallo sonne to Vigenius; Rimo the sonne of Peredurus; Geruntius the sonne of Elidurus; Catell that was buried at Winchester; Coill that was buried at Nottingham; Porrex a vertuous arid most gentle. prince; Cherinus a drunkard; Fulginius, Eldad, and Androgeus; these thr*entity*e were sonnes to Chercinus, and reigned successiuelie one after another; 

<note place="marg"><emph>Vrianus.</emph></note>

 after them a sonne of Androgeus; then Eliud, Dedaicus, Clotinius, Gurguntius, Merianus, Bledius, Cop, Owen, Sicilius, Bledgabredus an excellent musician: after him his brother Archemall; then Eldol, Red, Rodiecke, Samuill, Penisell, Pir, Capoir; after him his sonne Gligweil an vpright dealing prince, and a good iusticiarie; whom succeeded his sonne Helie, which reigned 60 yeares, as the forsaid Gal. Mon. writeth, where other affirme that he reigned 40 yeares, and some againe say that he reigned but 7 moneths.</p>
<p>There is great diuersitie in writers touching the reignes of these kings, and not onlie for the number of y*entity*eres which they should continue in their, reignes but also in their names: so that to shew the diuersitie of all the writers, were but to small purpose, sith the dooings of the same kings were not great by report made thereof by any approoued author. But this male suffice to aduertise you, that by conferring the y*entity*eres attributed to the other kings which reigned before them, since the comming of Brute, who should enter this land (as by the best writers is gatnered) about the y*entity*ere before the building of Rome 367, which was in the y*entity*ere after the creation of the world 2850 (as is said) with their time, there remaineth <pb n="463"/>182 y*entity*eres to be dealt amongst these 33 kings, which reigned betwixt the said Elidure *entity* Lud, which Lud also began his reigne after the building of the citie of Rome (as writers affirme) about 679 y*entity*eres, and in the y*entity*ere of the world 3895 as some that will s*entity*eme the precisest calculators doo gather.</p>
<p>Polydor Virgil changing (as I haue shewed) the order of succession in the British kings, in bringing diuerse of those kings, which after other writers followed Beline and Brenne, to prec*entity*ed them so successiuelie after Beline and Brenne, reherseth those that by his coniecture did by likelihood succ*entity*ed, as thus After the decesse of Beline, his sonne Gurguntius, being the second of that name, succeeded in gouernment of the land, and then these in order as they follow: Merianus, Bladanus, Capeus, Duinus, Sicilius, Biedgabredus, Archemallus, Eldorus, Rodianus, Redargius, Samulius, Penisellus, Pyrrhus, Caporus, Dinellus, and Helie, who had issue, Lud, Cassibellane, and Neurius.</p>

 proued a right worthie prince, amending the lawes of the realme that were defectiue, abolishing euill customs and maners vsed amongst his people, and repairing old cities and townes which were decaied: but speciallie he delited most to beautifie and inlarge with buildings the citie of Troinouant, which he compassed with a strong wall made of lime and stone, in the

 erected a strong gate, which he commanded to be called after his name, Luds gate, and so vnto this dale it is called Ludgate, (S) onelie drowned in pronuntiation of the word</p>

 and manie habitations were builded to receiue them, and he himselfe caused buildings to be made betwixt London stone and Ludgate, and builded for himselfe not farre from the said gate a faire palace, which is the bishop of Londons palace beside Paules at this daie,

<note place="marg">CASSIBELLANE.</note>

<p>CASSIBELLANE the brother of Lud was admitted king of Britaine, in the y*entity*ere of the world 3908, after the building of Rome 692, and before the comming of Christ 58 complet. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon. Matt. West. Fabian.</emph></note>

 For sith the two sonnes of Lud were not of age able to gouerne, the rule of the land was committed to Cassibellane: but yet (as some haue written) he was not created king, but rather appointed ruler *entity* protector of the land, during the nonage of his nephewes. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 Now after he was admitted (by whatsoeuer order) to the administration of the common wealth, he became so noble a prince and so bountious, that his name spred farre and n*entity*ere, and by his vpright dealing in seeing iustice executed he grew in such estimation, that the Britaines made small account of his nephewes, in comparison of the fauour which they bare towards him. But Cassibellane hauing respect to his honour, least it might be thought that his nephewes were expelled by him out of their rightfull possessions, brought them vp verie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West.</emph></note>

 honourablie; assigning to Androgeus, London and Kent; and to Theomantius the countrie of Cornwall. Thus farre out of the British histories, whereby it maie be gathered, that the y*entity*eres assigned to these kings that reigned before Cassibellane, amount to the summe of 1058.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

<p>But whether these gouernors (whose names we haue recited) were kings, or rather rulers of the common wealth, or tyrants and vsurpers of the gouernment by force, it is vncerteine: for not one ancient writer of anie approued authoritie maketh anie remembrance of them: and by that which lulius Caesar writeth, it maie and dooth app*entity*ere, that diuerse cities in his daies were gouerned of themselues, as h*entity*ereafter it shall more plainlie app*entity*ere. Neither doth he make mention of those townes which the British historie affirmeth to be built by the same kings. In d*entity*ed both he and other Latine writers speake of diuerse people that inhabited diuers portions of this land, as of the Brigantes, Trinobantes, lceni, Silures, and such other like, but in what parts most of the said people did certeinlie inhabit, it is hard to auouch for certeine truth.</p>
<p>But what Iohn Leland thinketh h*entity*ereof, being one in our time that curiouslie searched out old antiquities, you shall after heare as occasion serueth: and likewise the opinions of other, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boetius</emph> his fault.</note>

 as of Hector Boetius, who coueting to haue all such valiant acts as were atchiued by the Britains to be ascribed to his countriemen the Scots, draweth both the Silures and Brigantes, with other of the Britains so farre northward, that he maketh them inhabitants of the Scotish countries. And what particular names soeuer they had, yet were they all Scots with him, and knowne by that generall name (as he would persuade vs to bel*entity*eue) saieng that they entred into Britaine out of Ireland 330 y*entity*eres before the incarnation of our Sauiour.</p>
<p>Neuerthelesse, how generall soeuer the name of Scots then was, sure it is, that no speciall mention of them is made by anie writer, till about 300 yeares after the birth of our sauiour. And yet the Romans, which ruled this land, and had so much adoo with the people thereof, make mention of diuerse other people, nothing so famous as Boetius would make his Scotish men euen then to be. But to leaue to the Scots the antiquitie of their originall beginning, as they and other must doo vnto vs our descent from Brute and the other Troians, sith the

<p>In this season that Cassibellane had roiall gouernment h*entity*ere in Britaine, Caius Iulius 

<note place="marg">Iulius Cesar.</note>

 Caesar being appointe by the senat of Rome to conquer Gallia was for that purpose created consull, and sent with a mightie army into the countrie where after he had brought the Galles vnto some frame, he determined to assaie the winning of Britaine which as yet the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cesar de bello Gal. lib.</emph> 4. Britains vnknowne to the Romans. <emph>Cesar de bello Gall. lib.</emph> 4. Causes of the warre. Cesars purpose.</note>

 Romans knew not otherwise than by report. The chiefest cause that mooued him to take in hand that enterprise, was for that he did vnderstand, that there dailie came great succours out of that Ile to those Galles that were enimies vnto the Romans, And though the season of that y*entity*ere to make warre was farre spent (for summer was almost at an end) yet he thought it would be to good purpose, if he might but passe ouer thither, and learne what maner of people did inhabit there, and discouer the places, hauens, and entries apperteining to that Ile.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon calling togither such merchants as he knew to haue had traffike thither with some trade of wares, he diligentlie inquired of them the state of the Ile: but he could not be throughlie satisfied in anie of those things that he coueted to know. Therefore thinking it good to vnderstand all things by view that might apperteine to the vse of that warre which he purposed to follow: before he attempted the same, he sent one Caius Volusenus with a 

<note place="marg">Caius Voluscnus sent ouer into Britaine.</note>

 gallie or light pinesse to surueie the coasts of the Ile, commanding him (after diligent search made) to returne with sp*entity*ed to him againe. He him selfe also drew downewards towards Bullenois, from whence the shortest cut lieth to passe ouer into Britaine.</p>
<p>In that part of Gallia there was in those daies an hauen called <emph>Itius Portus</emph> (which some 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Leland. Polydor.</emph></note>

 take to be Calice) and so the word importeth, an harbourgh as then able to receiue a great number of ships. Vnto this hauen got Caesar all the ships he could out of the next borders *entity* parties, and those speciallie which he had prouided and put in a readinesse the last yeare for the warres (against them of Vannes in Armorica now called Britaine n France) he caused to be brought thither, there to lie till they should heare further. In the meane time 

<note place="marg">Vannes in Britane.</note>

 (his indeuour being knowne, and by merchants reported in Britane) all such as were able to beare armour, were commanded and appointed to repaire to the sea side, that they might be readie to defend their countrie in time of so great danger of inuasion.</p>
<p>*entity* Caesar in his commentaries agr*entity*eth not with our historiographers: for he writeth that immediatlie vpon knowledge had that he would inuade Britainie, there came to him ambassadours from diners cities of the lie to offer themselues to be subiects to the Roms, and to deliuer hostages. Whome after he had exhorted to continue in their good mind, he sent home againe, and with them also one Comius gouernor of Artois, commanding hi to 

<note place="marg">Comius.</note>

 repaire vnto as manie cities in Britaine as he might, and to exhort to exhort them to submit themselues to the Romans. He maketh no mention of Cassibellane, till the second iournie that he made into the lie, at what time the said Cassibelane was chosen (as ye shall heare) to be the generall capteine of the Britains, and to haue the whole administration of the warre for defense of the countrie: but he nameth him not to be a king. Howbeit in the British historie it is conteined, that Caesar required tribute of Cassibelane, and that he answered how he had 

<note place="marg">Which is more likelie in this behalfe, as appeared by the sequel.</note>

 not learned as yet to liue in seruage, but to defend the libertie of his countries and that with weapon in hand (if n*entity*ede were) as he should well perceiue, if (blinded through couetousnesse) he should aduenture to s*entity*eke to disquiet the Britains.</p>

For the Britains hearing that Caesar ment verie shortlie to come against them, were assembled in armour to resist him: and now being aduertised of his approch to the land, they prepared themselues to withstand him.</p>

<p>Caesar perceiuing this, determined to staie till the other ships were come, and so he lay at councell. anchor till about 11 of the clocke, and then called a councell of the marshals and chiefe capteines, vnto whome he declared both what he had learned of Volusenus, and also further what he would haue doone, willing them that all things might be ordered as the reason of warre required. And because he perceiued that this place where he first cast anchor was not m*entity*ete for the landing of his people, sith (from the heigth of the cliffes that closed on ech side the narrow cr*entity*eke into the which he had thrust) the Britains might annoy his people with their bowes and dartes, before they could set foote on land, hauing now the wind and tide with him, he disanchored from thence, and drew alongst the coast vnder the downes, the

Wherefore Caesar being thus preuented, inforced yet to land with his people, though he saw that he should haue much a doo. For as the Britains were in redinesse to resist him, so his great and huge ships could not come n*entity*ere the. shore, but were forced to

 k*entity*epe the d*entity*epe, so that the Romane soldiers were put to verie hard shift; to wit, both to leape forth of their ships, and being pestered with their heauie armour and weapons, to fight in the water with their enimies, who knowing the flats.and shelues, stood either vpon the drie ground, or else but a little waie in the shallow places of the water; and being not otherwise encumbred either with armour or weapon, but so as they might bestir themselues at will, they laid load vpon the Romans with their arrowes and darts, and forced their horsses (being thereto inured) to enter the water the more easilie, so to annoy and distresse the Romans, who wanting experience in such kind of fight, were not well able to helpe themselues, nor to keepe order as they vsed to doo on land: wherfore they fought nothing so lustilie as they were woont to doo. Caesar perceiuing this, commanded the gallies to depart from the great ships, and to row hard to the shore, that being placed ouer against the open sides of the Britains, they might with their shot of arrows, darts, and slings, remove the Britains, and cause them to withdraw further off from the water side.</p>

<p>This thing being put in execution (according to his commandement) the Britains were not

 a little astonied at the strange sight of those gallies, for that they were driuen with ores, which earst they had not s*entity*ene, and shrewdlie were they galled also with the artillerie which the Romans discharged vpon them, so that they began to shrinke and retire somewhat backe. Herewith one that bare the ensigne of the legion surnamed Decima, wherein the eagle was 

<note place="marg">The valiant courage of an ensigne bearer.</note>

 figured, as in that which was the chiefe ensigne of the legion, when he saw his fellowes nothing eager to make forward, first bes*entity*eching the gods that his enterprise might turne to the weale, profit, and honor of the legion, he spake with a lowd voice these words to his fellowes that were about him; "Leape forth now euen you woorthie souldiers (saith he) if you will not betraie your ensigne to the enimies: for surelie I will acquit my selfe according to my duetie both towards the common wealth, and my generall: "and therewith leaping forth into the water, he marched with his ensigne streight vpon the enimies. The Romans douting to lose their ensigne, which should haue turned them to great reproch, leapt out of their ships so fast as they might, and followed their standard, so that there ensued a sore reencounter: and that which troubled the Romans most, was because they could not keepe their order, neither find anie sure footing, nor yet follow euerie man his owne ensigne, but to put themselues vnder that ensigne which he first met withall after their first comming forth of the ship.</p>
<p>The Britains that were inured with the shelues and shallow places of the water, when they saw the Romans thus disorderlie come out of their ships, ran vpon them with their horsses, and fiercelie assailed them, and now and then a great multitude of the Britains would compasse

<note place="marg">Comius of Arras.</note>

 into Britaine, whome notwithstanding that he was an ambassadour, and sent from Caesar with commission and instructions sufficientlie furnished, yet had they staied him as a prisoner. But now after the battell was ended, they set him at libertie, and sent him backe with their ambassadours, who excused the matter, laieng the blame on the people of the countries which had imprisoned him through lacke of vnderstanding what apperteined to the law of armes and nations in that behalfe.</p>

<pb n="468"/>
<p>Caesar found great fault with their misdemenor, not onelie for imprisoning his ambassador but also for that contrarie to their promise made by such as they had sent to him into Gallia to deliuer hostages, in lieu thereof they had receiued him.with warre: yet in the end he said 

<note place="marg">Cesar demandeth hosrages.</note>

 he would pardon them, and not s*entity*eke anie further reuenge of their follies. And herewith required of them hostages, of which, part were deliuered out of hand, and made promise that the residue should likewise be sent after, crauing some respit for performance of the same, bicause they were to be fetched farre off within the countrie.</p>
<p>Peace being thus established after the fourth day of the Romans arriuall in Britaine, the 18 ships which (as ye haue heard) were appointed to conuey the horssemen ouer, loosed from the further hauen with a soft wind. Which when they approched so n*entity*ere the shore of Britaine, that the Romans which were in Caesars campe might see them, suddenlie there arose so great a tempest, that none of them was able to k*entity*epe his course, so that they were not onelie driuen in sunder (some being caried againe into Gallia, and some westward) but also the other ships that lay at anchor, and had brought ouer the armie, were so pitifullie beaten, tossed and shaken, that a great number of them did not onelie lose their tackle, but also were caried by force of wind into the high sea; the rest being likewise so filled with water, that they were in danger by sinking to perish and to be quite lost. For the moone in the same night was at the full, *entity* therefore caused a spring tide, which furthered the force of the tempest, to the greater perill of those ships and gallies that lay at anchor. There was no way for the Romans to helpe the matter: wherefore a great number of those ships were so bruised, rent and weather-beaten, that without new reparation they would serue to no vse of sailing. This was a great discomfort to the Romans that had brought ouer no prouision to liue by in the winter season, nor saw anie hope how they should repasse againe into Gallia.</p>
<p>In the meane time the British princes that were in the Romane armie, perceiuing how greatlie this mishap had discouraged the Romans, and again by the small circuit of their campe, gessing that they could be no great number, and that lacke of vittels sore oppressed them, they stale priuilie away one after another out of the campe, purposing to assemble their powers againe, and to forestall the Romans from vittels, and so to driue the matter off till winter: which if they might doo (vanquishing these or closing them from returning) they trusted that none of the Romans from thencefoorth would attempt eftsoones to come into Britaine. Caesar mistrusting their dealings, because they staid to deliuer the residue of their hostages, commanded yittels to be brought out of the parties adioining, and not hauing other stuffe to repaire his ships, he caused 12 of those that were vtterlie past recouerie by the hurts receiued through violence of the tempest, to be broken, wherewith, the other (in which some recouerie was perceiued) might be repaired and amended.</p>

<p>WHILEST these things were a dooing, it chanced that as one of the Romane legions named the seuenth, was sent to fetch in come out of the countrie adioining (as their custome was) no warre at that time being suspected, or once looked for, when part of the people remained abroad in the field, and part repaired to the campe: those that warded before the campe, informed Caesar, that there appeared a dust greater than was accustomed from that quarter, into the which the legion was gone to fetch in come. Caesar iudging therof what the matter might meane, commanded those bands that warded to go with him that way foorth, <pb n="469"/>and appointed other two bands to come into their roomes, and the residue of his people to get them to armor, and to follow quicklie after him.</p>
<p>He was not gone anie great way from the campe, when he might s*entity*e where his people were ouermatched by the enimies, and had much a doo to beare out the brunt: for the legion being thronged together, the Britains pelted them sore with arrowes and darts on ech side: for sithens there was no forrage left in anie part of the countrie about but onelie in this place the Britains iudged that the Romans would come thither for it: therefore hauing, lodged themselues within the woods in ambushes the night before; on the morrowe after when they saw the Romans dispersed here *entity* there, and busie to cut downe the corne, they set vpon them on a sudden, and sleaing some few of them, brought the residue out of order, compassing them about with their horssemen and charets, so that they were in great distresse.</p>
<p>The maner of fight with these charets was such, that in the beginning of a battell they would ride about the sides and skirts of the enimies host, and bestow their darts as they sate in those charets, so that oftentimes with the braieng of the horsses, and craking noise of the charet wh*entity*eles they disordered their enimies, and after that they had woond themselues in amongst the troops of horssemen, they would leape out of the charets and fight on foot. In the meane time those that guided the charets would withdraw them selues out of the battell, placing themselues so, that if their people were ouermatched with the multitude of enimies, they might easilie withdraw to their charets, and mount vpon the same againe, by meanes wherof they were as readie to remooue as the horssemen, and as stedfast to stand in the battell as the footmen, and so to supplie both duties in one. And those charetmen by exercise and custome were so cunning in their feat, that although their horsses were put to run and gallop, yet could they stay them and hold them backe at their pleasures, and turne and wind them to and fro in a momenta notwithstanding that the place were verie st*entity*epe and dangerous: and againe they would run vp and downe verie nimblie vpon the cops, and stand vpon the beame, and conuey themselues quicklie againe into the charet.</p>
<p>Caesar thus finding his people in great distresse and readie to be destroied, came in good time, and deliuered them out of that danger: for the Britains vpon his approch with new succors, gaue ouer to assaile their enimies any further *entity* the Romans were Romans were deliuered out of the feare wherein they stood before his comming. Furthermore, Caesar considering the time serued not to assaile his enimies, kept his ground, and shortlie after brought backe his legions into the campe.</p>
<p>While these things were thus a dooing, *entity* all the Romnans occupied, the rest that were abroad in the m away. After this this there followed a sore season of raine and fowle weather, which kept the Romans within their campe, and staid the Britains from offering battell. But in the meane time they sent messengers abroad into all parts of the countrie, to giue knowledge of the small number of the Romans, and what hope there was both of great spoile to be gotten, and occasion to deliuer themselues from further danger for euer, if they might once expell the Romans out of their campe. Herevpon a great multitude both of horssemen and footmen of the Britains were sp*entity*edilie got togither, and approched the Romane campe.</p>
<p>Caesar although he saw that the same would come to passe which had chanced before, that if the enimies were put to the repulse, they would easilie escape the danger with swiftnesse of foot; yet hauing. now with him thirtie horssemen (which Comius of Arras had brought ouer with him, when he was sent from Caesar as an ambassador vnto the Britains) he placed his legions in order of battell before his campe, and so comming to ioine with the Britains, they were not able to susteine the violent impression of the armed men, and so fled. The Romans pursued them so farre as they were able to ouertake anie of them, and so slaieng manie of them, *entity* burning vp all their houses all about, came backe againe to their campe. Immediatlie wherevpon, euen the same day, they sent ambassadors to Caesar to sue for peace, who gladlie accepting their offer, commanded them to send ouer into Gallia, after he should be returned thither, hostages in number duble to those that were agr*entity*ed vpon at the first. <pb n="470"/>After that these things were thus ordered, Caesar because the moneth of Septetmber was well-neare halfe spent, and that winter hasted on (a season not m*entity*et for his weake and bruised ships to brooke the seas) determined not to staie anie Ionger, but hauing wind and weather for his purpose, got himselfe aboord with his people, and returned into Gallia.</p>

Beda also writeth, that Caesar comming into the countrie of Gallia, where the people then called Morini inhabited (which are at this day the same that inhabit the diocesse of Terwine) from whence lieth the shortest passage ouer into Britaine, now called England, got togither SO saile of great ships and row gallies, wherewith he passed ouer into Britaine, *entity* there at the first being wearied with sharpe and sore fight, and after taken with a grieuous tempest, he lost the greater part of his nauie, with no small number of his souldiers, and almost all his horssemen: and therwith being returned into Gallia, placed his souldiors in st*entity*eds to soiourne there for the winter season. Thus saith Bede. The British historie moreouer maketh mention of thr*entity*e vnder-kings that aided Cassibellane in this first battell fought with Caesar, as Cridiorus alias Ederus, king of Albania, now called Scotland: Guitethus king of Venedocia, that is Northwales: and Britaell king of Demetia, at this day called Southwales.</p>
<p>The same historie also maketh mention of one Belinus that was generall of Cassibellanes armie, and likewise of Nenius brother to Cassibellane, who in fight happened to get Caesars swoord fastened in his shield by a blow which Caesar stroke at him. Androgeus also and Tenancius were at the battell in aid of Cassibellane. But Nenius died within 15 daies after the battell of the hurt receiued at Caesars hand, although after he was so hurt, he slue Labienus one of the Romane tribunes: all which may well be true, sith Caesar either maketh the best of things for his owne honour, or else coueting to write but commentaries, maketh no account to declare the n*entity*edeles circumstances, or anie more of the matter, than the chiefe points of his dealing.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

<p>Againe, the Scotish historiographers write, that when it was first knowne to the Britains, that Caesar would inuade them, there came from Cassibellane king of Britaine an ambassador vnto Ederus king of Scots, who in the name of king Cassibellane required aid against the common enimies the Romains, which request was granted, and 10 thousand Scots sent to the aid of Cassibellane. At their comming to London, they were most ioifullie receiued of Cassibellane, who at the same time had knowledge that the Romans were come on land, and had beaten such Britains backe as were appointed to resist their landing. Wherevpon Cassibellane with all his whole puissance nightilie augmented, not onlie with the succours of the Scots, but also of the Picts (which in that common cause had sent also of their people to aid the Britains) set forward towards the place where he vnderstood the enimies to be.</p>
<p>At their first approch togither, Cassibellane sent foorth his horssemen and charets called <emph>Esseda,</emph> by the which he thought to disorder the araie of the enimies. Twice they incountred togither with doubtfull victorie. At length they ioined puissance against puissance, and fought a verie sore and cruell battell, till finally at the sudden comming of the Welshmen and Cornishmen, so huge a noise was raised by the sound of bels hanging at their trappers and charets, that the Romans astonied therewith, were more easilie put to flight. The Britains, Scots, and Picts following the chase without order or araie, so that by reason the Romans kept themselues close togither, the Britains, Scots, *entity* Picts did scarse so much harme to the enimies as they themselues receiued. But yet they followed on still vpon the Romans till it was darke night.</p>
<p>Caesar after he had perceiued them once withdrawne, did what he could to assemble his companies togither, minding the next morning to s*entity*eke his reuenge of the former daies disaduantage. But forsomuch as knowledge was giuen him that his ships (by reason of a sore tempest) were so beaten and rent, that manie of them were past seruice, he doubted least such newes would incourage his enimies, and bring his people into despaire. Wherfore he <pb n="471"/>determined not to fight till time more conuenient, sending all his. wounded folks vnto the ships, which he commanded to be newlie rigged and trimmed. After this, k*entity*eping his armie for a time within the place where he was incamped without issuing foorth he shortlie drew to the sea side, where his ships laie at anchor, and there within a strong place fortified for the purpose he lodged his host, and finallie without hope to atchieue anie other exploit auaileable for that time, he tooke the sea with such ships as were apt for sailing, and so repassed into Gallia, leauing behind him all the spoile and baggage for want of vessels and leisure to conueie it ouer. *entity* Thus haue the Scots in their chronicles framed the matter, more to the conformitie of the Romane histories, than according to the report of our British and English writers: and therefore we haue thought good to shew it h*entity*ere, that the diuersitie of writers and their affections may the better app*entity*ere.</p>
<p>Of this sudden departing also or rather fl*entity*eing of Iulius Caesar out of Britaine, Lucanus. the poet maketh mention, reciting the saieng of Pompeius in an oration made by him vntao his souldiers, wherin he reprochfullie and disdainfullie reprooued the dooings of Caesar in Britaine, saieng:

<p>NOW will we returne to the sequele of the matter, as Caesar himselfe reporteth. After his comming into Gallia, there were but two cities of all Britaine that sent ouer their hostages according to. their couenant, which gaue occasion, to Cesar to picke a new quarrell 

<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassion</emph></note>

 against them, which if it had wanted, he would yet (I doubt not) haue found some other: for his full meaning was to make a more full conquest of that Ile. Therefore purposing to passe againe thither, as he that had a great desire to bring the Britains vnder the obedience of the Romane estate, he caused a great number of ships to be prouided in the winter season and put in a readinesse, so that against the next spring there were found to be readie rigged six hundred ships, beside 28 gallies. H*entity*erevpon hauing taken order for the gouernance 

<note place="marg"><emph>Casar de bello Gal. libe</emph> 5.</note>

 of Gallia in his absence, about the beginning of the spring he came to the hauen of Calice, whither (according to order by him prescribed) all his ships were come, except 40 which by tempest were driuen backe, and could not as yet come to him.</p>
<p>After he had staied at Calice (as well, for a conuenient wind, as for other incidents) certeine daies, at length when the weather so changed that it serued his purpose, he tooke the sea, *entity* hauing with him fiue legions of souldiers, and about two thousand horssemen, he departed out of Calice hauen about sun setting with a soft southwest wind, directing his course forward: about midnight the wind fell, *entity* so by a calme he was carried alongst with the tide, so that in the morning when the day app*entity*ered, he might behold Britaine vpon his left hand. Then following the streame as. the course of the tide changed, he forced with oares to fetch the shore vpon that part of the coast, which he had discouered, and tried the last yeere to be the best landing place for the armie. The diligence of the souldiers was shewed h*entity*ere to be great, who with continuall toile droue foorth the heauie ships, to k*entity*epe course with the gallies, *entity* so at length they. landed in Britaine about noone on the next day, finding not one to resist his comming ashore: for as he learned by certeine prisoners which were taken after his comming to land, the Britains being assembled in purpose to haue resisted. him, through feare striken into their harts, at the discouering of <pb n="472"/>such an huge number of ships, they forsooke the shore and got them vnto the mountaines There were in deed of vessels one and other, what with vittellers, *entity* those which priuat men had prouided and furnished foorth for their owne vse, being ioined to the ordinarie number, at the least eight hundred saile, which appeering in sight all at one time, made a wonderfull muster, and right terrible in the eies of the Britains.</p>
<p>But to proc*entity*ed: Caesar being got to land, incamped his armie in a place conuenient: and after learning by the prisoners, into what part the enimies were withdrawne, he appointed one Quintus Atrius to remaine vpon the safegard of the nauie, with ten companies or cohorts of footmen, and three hundred horssemen: and anon after midnight marched foorth himselfe with the residue of his people toward the Britains, and hauing made 12 miles of way, he got sight of his enimies host, who sending downe their horssemen and charets vnto the riuer side, skirmished with the Romans, meaning to beate them backe from the higher ground: but being assailed of the Romane horssemen, they were repelled, *entity* tooke the woods for their refuge, wherein they had got a place verie strong, both by nature and helpe of hand, which (as was to be thought) had b*entity*ene fortified before, in time of some ciuill warre amongst them: for all the entries were closed with tr*entity*es which had b*entity*ene cut downe for that purpose. Howbeit the souldiers of the 7 legion casting a trench before them, found meanes to put backe the Britains from their defenses, and so entring vpon them, droue them out of the woods. But Caesar would not suffer the Romans to follow the Britains, bicause the nature of the countrie was not knowne vnto them: and againe the day was farre spent, so that he would haue the residue thereof bestowed in fortifieng his campe.</p>
<p>The next day, as he had sent foorth such as should haue pursued the Britains, word came to him from Quintus Atrius, that his nauie by rigour of a sore and hideous tempest was gr*entity*euouslie molested, and throwne vpon the shore, so that the cabels and tackle being broken and destroied with force of the vnmercifull rage of wind, the maisters and mariners were not able to helpe the matter. Caesar calling backe those which he had sent foorth, returned to his ships, and finding them in such state as he had heard, tooke order for the repairing of those that were not vtterlie destroied, and caused them so to be drawne vp to the land, that with a trench he might so compasse in a plot of ground, that might serue both for defense of his ships, and also for the incamping of those men of warre, which he should leaue to attend vpon the safegard of the same. And bicause there were at the least a fortie ships lost by violence of this tempest, so as there was no hope of recouerie in them, he saw yet how the rest with great labour and cost might be repaired: wherefore he chose out wrights among the legions, sent for other into Gallia, and wrote ouer to such as he had left there in charge with the gouernment of the countrie to prouide so manie ships as they could, and to send them ouer vnto him. He spent a ten daies about the repairing of his nauie, and in fortifieng the campe for defense thereof, which done, he left those within it that were appointed there before, and then returned towards his enimies.</p>
<p>At his comming backe to the place where he had before incamped, he found them there readie to resist him, hauing their numbers hugelie increased: for the Britains hearing that he was returned with such a mightie number of ships assembled out of all parts of the land, and had by general consent appointed the whole rule and order of all things touching the warre vnto Cassiuellane or Cassibelane, whose dominion was diuided from the cities situat n*entity*ere to the sea coast, by the riuer of Thames, 80 miles distant from the sea coast. 

<note place="marg">Cassibellane as should s*entity*eme, ruled in the parties of Oxfordshire, Barkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Bedfordshire.</note>

 This Cassibellane before time had bin at continuall warre with other rulers, and cities of the land: but now the Britains moued with the comming of the Romans, chose him to be chiefe gouernour of all their armie, permitting the order and rule of all things touching the defense of their countrie against the Romans onelie to him. Their horssemen and charets skirmished by the waie with the Romans, but so as they were put backe oftentimes into the woods and hills adioining: yet the Britains slue diuers of the Romans as they followed anie thing egerlie in the pursute.</p>

<pb n="473"/>
<p>Also within a while after, as the Romans were busie in fortifieng their campe, the Britains suddenlie issued out of the woods, and fierselie assailed those that warded before the campe, vnto whose aid Caesar sent two of the chiefest cohorts of two legions, the which being placed but a little distance one from another, when the Romans began to be discouraged with this kind of fight, the Britains therewith burst through their enimies, and came backe from thence in safetie That daie Quintus Laberius Durus a tribune was slaine. At length Cesar sending sundrie other cohorts to the succour of his people that were in fight, and shrewdlie handled as it app*entity*ered, the Britains in the end were put backe. Neuerthelesse, that repulse was but at the pleasure of fortune; for they quited themselues afterwards like men, defending their territories with such munition as they had, vntill such time as either by policie or inequalitie of power they were vanquished; as you shall s*entity*e after in the course of the historie. Howbeit in fine they were ouer-run and vtterlie subdued, but not without much bloudshed and slaughter.</p>

 armour (being not able either to follow the Britains as they retired, or so bold as to depart from their ensignes, except they would runne into danger of casting themselues awaie) were nothing m*entity*ete to match with such kind of enimies: and as for their horssemen, they fought likewise in great hazard, bicause the Britains would oftentimes of purpose retire, and when they had trained the Romane horssemen a litle from their legions of footmen, they would leape out of their charrets and incounter with them on foot. And so the battell of horssemen was dangerous, and like in all points whether they pursued or retired.</p>
<p>This also was the maner of the Britains: they fought not close togither, but in sunder, 

<note place="marg">The manner of the Britains in the warres.</note>

 and diuided into companies one separated from another by a good distance, and had their troopes standing in places conuenient, to the which they might retire, and so rel*entity*eue one another with sending new fresh men to supplie the roomes of them that were hurt or wearie. The next day after they had thus fought before the campe of the Romans, they shewed themselues aloft on the hills, and began to skirmish with the Romane horssemen, but not so hotlie as they had doone the day before. But about noone, when Caesar had sent foorth thr*entity*e legions of footemen and all his horssemen vnder the leading of his lieutenant Caius Trebonius to fetch in forrage, they suddenlie brake out on euerie side, and 

<note place="marg">Caius Trebonius.</note>

 set vpon the forragers. The Romans so far foorth as they might, not breaking their arraie, nor going from their ensignes or guidons, gaue the charge on them, and fiercelie repelled 

<note place="marg"><emph>Diou Cassius</emph> saith, that the Britains vanquished the Roman footmen at this time, but were put to the worst by the horssemen.</note>

 them, so that the horssemen hauing the legions of footemen at their backs, followed the Britains so long as they might haue the said legions in sight readie to succour them if need were: by reason whereof, they slue a great number of the Britains, not giuing them leasure to recouer themselues, nor to staie that they might haue time to get out of their charrets. After this chase and discomfiture, all such as were come from other parties to the aid of their fellowes departed home, *entity* after that day the Britains aduentured to fight against Caesar with their maine power; and withdrawing beyond the riuer of 

<note place="marg">(which is to be supposed was at Kingston) or not far from thence.</note>

 Thames, determined to stop the enimies from passing the same, if by anie meanes they might: and <pb n="474"/>whereas there was but one foord by the which they might come ouer, Cassibellane caused the same to be set full of sharpe stakes, not onlie in the middest of the water, but also at the comming foorth on that side where he was lodged with his armie in good order, readie to defend the passage. Caesar learning by relation of prisoners which he tooke, what the Britains intended to doo, marched foorth to the riuer side, where the foord was, by the which his armie might passe the same on foot though verie hardlie. At his comming thither, he might perceiue how the Britains were readie on the further side to impeach his passage, and how that the banke at the comming foorth of the water was pight full of sharpe stakes, and so likewise was the chanell of the riuer set with piles which were couered with the water.</p>
<p>These things yet staied not Caesar, who appointing his horssemen to passe on before, commanded the footemen to follow. The souldiers entring the water, waded through with such sp*entity*ed and violence (nothing app*entity*ering of them aboue water but their heads) that the Britains were constreined to giue place, being not able to susteine the brunt of the Romane horssemen, and the legions of their footemen, and so abandoning the place betooke them to flight. Cassibellane not minding to trie the matter anie more by battell, sent awaie the most part of his people, but yet kept with him about a foure thousand charretmen or wagoners, and still watched what waie the Romans tooke, coasting them euer as they marched, and kept somewhat aside within the couert of woods, and other combersome places. And out of those quarters through which he vnderstood the Romans wold passe, he gathered both men and cattell into the woods *entity* thicke forrests, leauing nothing of value abroad in the champion countrie. And when the Roman horssemen did come abroad into the countrie to s*entity*eke booties, he sent out his charrets vnto the knowne waies and passages to skirmish with the same horssemen, so much to the disaduantage of the Romans, that they durst not straie farre from their maine armie. Neither would Caesar permit them (least they might haue b*entity*ene vtterlie distressed by the Britains) to depart further than the maine battels of the footemen kept pace with them, by reason whereof the countrie was not indamaged by fire and spoile but onlie where the armie marched.</p>

<note place="marg">Troinouants where they inhabited.</note>

<p>In the meane time, the Troinouants which some take to be Middlesex *entity* Essex men, whose citie was the best fensed of all those parties, and thought to be the same that now is called London, sent ambassadours vnto Cesar, offering to submit themselues vnto him, and to obeie his ordinances, and further besought him to defend Mandubratius from the iniuries of K. Cassibellane, which Mandubratius had fled vnto Caesar into France, after 

<note place="marg"><emph>Imanuentius.</emph></note>

 that Cassibellane had slaine his father named Imanuentius, that was chiefe lord and king of the Troinouants, and so now by their ambassadors the same Troinouants requested Caesar, not onelie to receiue Mandubratius into his protection, but also to send him vnto them, that he might take the gouernment and rule of their citie into his hands. Cesar commanded them to deliuer vnto him 40 hostages, and graine for his armie, and therewith 

<note place="marg">Some take the <unclear></unclear> to or Londoner</note>

 sent Mandubratius vnto them. The Troinouants accomplished his commandements with all sp*entity*ed, sending both the appointed number of hostages, and also graine for the armie. And being thus defended and preserued from iniurie of the souldiers, the people called Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, and Cassi, submitted themselues vnto Cesar, by whom he vnderstood that the towne of Cassibellane was not far from the place where he was then incamped fensed with wooddes and marishes, into the which a great number of people with their cattell and other substance was withdrawne. The Britains in those daies (as Cesar writeth) called that a towne or hold, which they had fortified with anie thicke combersome wood, with trench and rampire, into the which they vsed to get themselues for the auoiding of inuasion.</p>
<p>Cesar with his legions of souldiers therfore marched thither, and finding the place verie strong both by nature and helpe of hand, assaulted it on two partes. The Britains defending their strength a while, at length not able longer to endure the impression of the Romans, fled out on the contrarie side of the towne where the enimies were not. Within this place <pb n="475"/>a great number of cattell was found, and manie of the Romans taken by the Britains that followed them in chase, and manie also slaine.</p>

<head type="unitnum">The Xvj. Chapter.</head>
<p>NOW whilest these thinges passed on this sort in those parts, Cassibellane sent messengers into Kent vnto foure kings (which ruled that side of the land in those daies) Cingetorix, 

<note place="marg">Foure kings in Kent.</note>

 Caruilius, Taximagulus, and Segonax, commanding them, that assembling togither their whole puissance, they should assaile the campe of the Romans by the sea side where certeine bands lay (as ye haue heard) for safegard of the nauie. They according to his appointment came suddenlie thither, and by the Romans that sailed forth vpon them were sharplie fought with, and lost diuers of their men that were slaine and taken, and amongst the prisoners that the Romans tooke, Cingetorix was one. When Cassibellane heard these newes, being sore troubled for these losses thus chancing one in the necke of an other, but namelie most discouraged, for that diuers cities had yeelded vnto the Romans: he sent ambassadours by means of Romius of Arras vnto Cesar, offering to submit himselfe.</p>
<p>Cesar meaning to winter in Gallia, and therefore because summer drew towards an end, willing to dispatch in Britaine, commanded that hostages should be deliuered, and appointed what tribute the Britains should y*entity*erelie send vnto the Romans. He also forbad and commanded Cassibellane, that he should not in anie wise trouble or indamage Madubratius or the Londoners. After this, when he had receiued the hostages, he brought his armie to the sea, and there found his ships well repaired, decked, and in good point: therefore he commanded that they should be had downe to the sea. And because he had a great number of prisoners, and diuers of his ships were lost in the tempest, he appointed to transport his armie ouer into Gallia at two conueies, which was doone with good successe about the middest of September, though the ships returning for the residue of the armie, after the first conueie, were driuen so with force of weather, that a great number of them could not come to land at the place appointed: so that Caesar was constreined to fraught those that he could get with a greater burden, and so departed from the coast of Britaine, and safelie landed with the remnant of his people in Gallia with as good sp*entity*ed as he could haue desired. He thought not good to leaue anie of his people behind him, knowing that if he

<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassius</emph></note>

 should so doo, they were in danger to be cast awaie. And so because he could not well remaine there all the winter season for doubt of rebellion in Gallia, he was contented to take vp, and returne thither, sith he had doone sufficientlie for the time, least in coueting the more, he might haue come in perill to lose that which he had alreadie obteined.</p>
<p>Thus according to that which Cesar himselfe and other autentike authors haue written, was Britaine made tributarie to the Romans by the conduct of the same Cesar. *entity* But our histores farre differ from this, affirming that Caesar comming the second time, was by 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon. Matt. West.</emph></note>

 the Britains with valiancie and martiall prowesse beaten and repelled, as he was at the first, and speciallie by meanes that Cassibellane had pight in the Thames great piles of tr*entity*es <pb n="476"/>piked with yron, through which his ships being entred the riuer, were perished and lost. And after his comming a land, he was vanquished in battell, and consfrained to flee into Gallia with those ships that remained. For ioy of this second victorie (saith Galfrid) Cassibellane made a great feast at London, and there did sacrifice to the gods.</p>
<p>At this feast there fell variance betwixt two yoong gentlemen, the on named Hirilda nephew to Cassibellane, and the other Euelie or Eweline, being of aliance to Androgeus earle of London. They fell at discord about wrestling, and after multiplieng of words, they came to dealing of blowes, by meanes whereof parts were taken, so that there ensued a sore fraie, in the which diuerse were wounded and hurt, and amongst other Hirilda the kings nephew was slaine by the hands of Eweline. The king sore displeased herewith, meant to punish Eweline according to the order of his lawes, so that he was summoned to appeare in due forme to make answer to the murder: but Eweline by the comfort of Androgeus disobeied the summons, *entity* departed the court with Androgeus, in contempt of the king and his lawes. The king to be reuenged vpon Androgeus, gathered a power, and began to make warre vpon him.</p>
<p>Androgeus perceiuing himselfe not able to withstand the kings puissance, sent letters to Iulius Cesar, exhorting him to returne into Britaine, and declaring the whole matter concerning the variance betwixt him and the king, promising to aid the Romans in all that he might. Iulius Caesar ioifull of this message, prepared his nauie, and with all sp*entity*ed with a mightie host imbarked in the same, came toward Britaine: but yer he would land, doubting some treason in Androgeus, he receiued from him in hostage his sonne named Scena, and thirtie other of the best and most noble personages of all his dominion. After this he landed, and ioining with Androgeus, came into a vallie n*entity*ere to Canturburie, and there incamped. Shortlie after came Cassibellane with all his power of Britains, and gaue battell to the Romans. But after the Britains had long fought and knightlie borne themselues in that battell, Androgeus came with his people on a wing, and so sharplie assailed them, that the Britains were constrained to forsake the field, and tooke themselues to flight. The which flight so discomforted them, that finallie they all fled, and gaue place to the Romans, the which pursued and slue them without mercie, so that Cassibellane with the residue of his people withdrew to a place of suertie, but being enuironed about with the puissance of the Romans, and of Androgeus, who had with him seuen thousand men there in the aid of the Romans, 

<note place="marg">So saith <emph>Campion,</emph> but <emph>Galfrid Monu.</emph> saith fiue thousand.</note>

 Cassibellane in the end was forced to fall to a composition, in couenanting to paie a yearelie tribute of thr*entity*e thousand pounds. When Cesar had ordered his businesse as he thought conuenient, he returned; and with him went Androgeus, fearing the displeasure of Cassibellane.</p>
<p>The reuerend father Bede writing of this matter, saith thus: After that Cesar being returned into Gallia, had placed his souldiors abroad in the countrie to soiorne for the winter season, he caused ships to be made readie, to the number of 600, with the which repassing into Britaine, whilest he marched foorth with a mightie armie against the enimies, his ships that lay at anchor being taken with a sore tempest, were either beaten one against another, or else cast vpon the flats and sands, and so broken; so that fortie of them were vtterlie perished, and the residue with great difficultie were repaired; The horssemen of the Romans at the first encounter were put to the worsse, and Labienus the tribune slaine. Ir the second conflict he vanquished the Britains, not without great danger of his people. After this, he marched to the riuer of Thames, which as then was passable by foord onelie in one place and not else, as the report goeth. On the further banke of that riuer, Cassibellane was incamped with an huge multitude of enimies, and had pitcht and set the banke, 

<note place="marg">The stakes remained to be s*entity*ene in Bedes daies.</note>

 and almost all the foord vnder the water full of sharpe stakes, the tokens of which vnto this day are to be s*entity*ene, and it s*entity*emeth to the beholders that euerie of these stakes are as big as a mans thigh, sticking fast in the bottome of the riuer closed with lead. This being perceiued of the Romans, and auoided, the Britains not able to susteine the violent impression of the Roman legions, hid themselues in the woods, out of the which by often issues, they gr*entity*euouslie and manie times assailed the Romans, and did them great damage. In the <pb n="477"/>meane time the strong citie of Troinouant with hir duke Androgeus deliuering fortie hostages, y*entity*elded vnto Cesar, whose example manie other cities following, allied themselues with the Romans, by whose information Cesar with sore fight took at length the towne of Cassibellane, situat betwixt two marches, fensed also with the couert of woods, *entity* hauing within it great plentie of all things. After this Cesar returned into France, and bestowed his armie in places to soiorne there for the winter season.</p>
<p>The Scoish writers report, that the Britains, after the Romans were the first time repelled (as before ye haue heard) refused to receiue the aid of the Scotish men the second time, and so were vanquished, as in the Scotish historie ye may see more at length expressed. Thus much touching the war which Iulius Cesar made against the Britains, in bringing them vnder tribute to the Romans. But this tributarie subiection was hardlie mainteined for a season.</p>
<p>*entity* Now here is to be noted, that Cesar did not vanquish all the Britains: for he came not amongst the northerne men, onlie discouering and subduing that part which lieth towards the French seas: so that sith other of the Roman emperors did most earnestlie trauell to bring the Britains vnder their subiection (which were euer redie to rebell so manie sundrie

 times) Cesar might s*entity*eme rather to haue shewed Britaine to the Romans, than to haue deliuered liuered the possession of the same. This subiection, to the which he brought this Ile (what maner of one soeuer it was) chanced about the yeare of the world 3913, after the building of Rome 698, before the birth of our sauior 53, the first and second yeare of the 181 Olympiad, after the comming of Brute 1060, before the conquest made by William duke of Normandie 1120, and 1638 yeres before this present yere of our Lord 1585, after Harisons account.</p>

<head type="title"> The state of Britaine when C*entity*sar offered to conquer it, and the maner of their gouernement, as diuerse authors report the same in their bookes: where the contrarietie of their opinions is to be obserued.</head>
<head type="unitnum">The Xvij. Chapter.</head>
<p>AFTER that Iulius Cesar had thus made the Britains tributaries to the Romans, and was returned into Gallia, Cassibellane reigned 7 yeares, and was vanquished in the ninth or tenth yeare after be began first to reigne so that he reigned in the whole about 15 or as some haue 17 yeares, and then died, leauing no issue behind him. There hath bin an old chronicle (as Fabian recordeth) which he saw and followeth much in his booke, wherein is conteined, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 that this Cassibellane was not brother to Lud, but eldest sonne to him: for otherwise as may be thought (saith he) Cesar hauing the vpper hand, would haue displaced him from the gouernement, and set vp Androgeus the right heire to the crowne, as sonne to the said Lud. But whatsoeuer our chronicles or the British histories report of this matter, it should appere by that which Cesar writeth (as partlie ye haue heard) that Britaine in those daies was 

<note place="marg"><emph>C*entity*sar.</emph></note>

 not gouerned by one sole prince, but by diuers, and that diuers cities were estates of themselues, so that the land was diuided into sundrie gouernements, much after the forme and maner as Germanie and Italie are in our time, where some cities are gouerned by one onelie prince, some by the nobilitie, and some by the people. And whereas diuers of the rulers in those daies here in this land were called kings, those had more large seigniories than the other, as Cassibellane, who was therefore called a king.</p>

<note place="marg">Cassibellane *entity* king</note>

<p>And though we doo admit this to be true, yet may it be, that in the beginning, after Brute entered the land, there was ordeined by him a monarchie, as before is mentioned, which might continue in his posteritie manie yeares after, and yet at length before the comming <pb n="478"/>of Cesar, through ciuil dissention, might happilie be broken, and diuided into parts and so remained not onelie in the time of this Cassibellane, but also long after, whitest they liued as tributaries to the Romans, till finallie they were subdued by the Saxons. In which meane time, through the discord, negligence, or rather vnaduised rashnes of writers, hard it is to iudge what may be affirmed and receiued in their writings for a truth namelie, concerning the succession of the kings that are said to haue reigned betwixt the daies of Cassibellane, 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>C r.</unclear> Tacit. in <unclear></unclear> In. Agr.</emph></note>

 bellane, and the comming of the Saxons. The Roman writers (and namelie Tacitus) report, that the Britains in times past were vnder the rule of kings, and after being made tributaries were drawne so by princes into sundrie factions, that to defend and k*entity*epe off a common ieopardie, scarselie would two or thr*entity*e cities agr*entity*e togither, and take weapon in hand with one accord, so that while they fought by parts, the whole was ouercome. And after this sort they say that Britaine was brought into the forme of a prouince by the Romans, from whom gouernors vnder the name of legats and procurators were sent that had the rule of it.</p>
<p>But yet the same authors make mention of certeine kings (as hereafter shall appeare) who while the Romane emperors had the most part of the earth in subiection, reigned in Britaine. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gildas in epist.</emph></note>

 The same witnesseth Gildas, saieng: Britaine hath kings, but they are tyrants: iudges it hath, but the same are wicked, oftentimes spoiling and tormenting the innocent people. And Cesar (as ye haue heard) speaketh of foure kings that ruled in Kent, and thereabouts. 

<note place="marg">Some take prasutagus and Aruiragus to be one man.</note>

 Cornelius Tacitus maketh mention of Prasutagus, and Cogidunus, that were kings in Britaine: and Iuuenal speaketh of Aruiragus: and all the late writers, of Lucius. Hereby it appeareth, that whether one or mo, yet kings there were in Britain, bearing rule vnder the Romane emperors.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

<p>On the other part, the common opinion of our chronicle writers is, that the chiefe gouernment remained euer with the Britains, *entity* that the Romane senat receiuing a yearelie tribute, sent at certeine times (<emph>E officio</emph>) their emperors and lieutenants into this Ile, to represse the rebellious tumults therein begun, or to beat backe the inuasion of the enimies that went about to inuade it. And thus would these writers inferre, that the Britains euer obeied their king, till at length they were put beside the gouernement by the Saxons, But whereas in the common historie of England, the succession of kings ought to be kept, so oft as it chanceth in the same that there is not anie to fill the place, then one while the Romane emperors are placed in their steads, and another while their lieutenants, and are said to be created kings of the Britains, as though the emperors were inferiors vnto the kings of Britaine, and that the Romane lieutenants at their appointments, and not by prescript of the senat or emperours, administred the prouince.</p>
<p>This may suffice here to aduertise you of the contrarietie in writers. Now we will go. foorth in following our historie, as we haue doone heretofore, sauing that where the Romane histories write of things done here by emperors, or their lieutenants, it shall be shewed as reason requireth, sith there is a great appearance of truth oftentimes in the same, as those that be authorised and allowed in the opinion of the learned.</p>

<p>*entity* But here is to be noted, that although our histories doo affirme, that as well this Kymbeline, as also his father Theomantius liued in quiet with the Romans, and continuallie to them paied the tributes which the Britains had couenanted with Iulius Cesar to pay, yet we find in the Romane writers, that after Iulius Cesars death, when Augustus had taken vpon him the rule of the empire, the Britains refused to paie that tribute: whereat as Cornelius 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cor. Tacitus. in vita lu. Ag-Dion Cassius.</emph></note>

 Tacitus reporteth, Augustus (being otherwise occupied) was contented to winke; howbeit, through earnest calling vpon to recouer his right by such as were desirous to. s*entity*e the vttermost of the British kingdome; at length, to wit, in the tenth yeare after the death of Iulius Cesar, which was about the thirt*entity*enth yeare of the said Theomantius, Augustus made prouision to passe with an armie ouer into Britaine, *entity* was come forward vpon his iournie into Gallia 

<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassius.</emph></note>

 Celtica: or as we maie saie, into these hither parts of France.</p>
<p>But here receiuing aduertisements that the Pannonians, which inhabited the countrie now called Hungarie, and the Dalmatians whome now we call Slauons had rebelled, he thought it best first to subdue those rebells neere home, rather than to s*entity*eke new countries, and leaue such in hazard whereof he had present possession, and so turning his power against the Pannonians and Dalmatians, he left off for a time the warres of Britaine, whereby the land remained without feare of anie inuasion to be made by the Romans, till the yeare after the building of the citie of Rome 725, and about the 19 yeare of king Theomantius reigne, that Augustus with an armie departed once againe from Rome to passe ouer into Britaine, there to make warre. But after his comming into Gallia, when the Britains sent to him certeine ambassadours to treat with him of peace, he staled there to settle the state of things among the Galles, for that they were not in verie good order. And hauing finished there, he went into Spaine, and so his iournie into Britaine was put off till the next yeare, that is, the 726 after the building of Rome, which fell before the birth of our sauiour 25, about which time Augustus eftsoons meant the third time to haue made a voiage into Britaine, because they could not agr*entity*e vpon couenants. But as the Pannonians and Dalmatians had aforetime staled 

<note place="marg">He kept not promise with the Romans. Those of Calice and Biskaie.</note>

 him, when (as before is said) he meant to haue gone against the Britans: so euen now the Salassians (a people inhabiting about Italie and Switserland) the Cantabrians and Asturians <pb n="480"/>by such rebellious sturrs as they raised, withdrew him from his purposed iournie, But whether this controuersie which appeareth to fall forth betwixt the Britains and Augustus was occasioned by Kymbeline, or some other prince of the Britains, I haue not to auouch: for that by our writers it is reported, that Kymbeline being brought vp in Rome, *entity* knighted in the court of Augustus, euer shewed himselfe a friend to the Romans, *entity* chieflie was loth to breake with them, because the youth of the Britaine nation should not be depriued of the benefit to be trained and brought vp among the Romans, whereby they might learne both to behaue themselues like ciuill men, and to atteine to the knowledge of feats of warre.</p>
<p>But whether for this respect, or for that it pleased the almightie God so to dispose the minds of men at that present, not onlie the Britains, but in manner all other nations were contented to be obedient to the Romane empire. That this was true in the Britains, it is 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear> ah.</unclear> Coog.</emph></note>

 euident enough by Strabos words, which are in effect as followeth. "At this present (saith he) certeine princes of Britaine, procuring by ambassadors and dutifull demeanors the amitie of the emperour Augustus, haue offered in the capitoll vnto the gods presents or gifts, and haue ordeined the whole Ile in a manner to be appertinent, proper, and familiar to the Romans. They are burdened with sore customs which they paie for wares, either to be sent foorth into Gallia, or brought from thence, which are commonlie yuorie vessels, sh*entity*eres, ouches, or earerings, and other conceits made of amber *entity* glasses, and such like manner of merchandize: so that now there is no n*entity*ed of anie armie or garrison of men of warre to k*entity*epe the Ile, for there n*entity*edeth not past one legion of footmen, or some wing of horssemen, to gather vp and receiue the tribute: for the charges are rated according to the quantitie of the tributes: for otherwise it should be n*entity*edfull to abate the customs, if the tributes were also raised: and if anie violence should be vsed, it were dangerous least they might be prouoked to rebellion." Thus farre Strabo.</p>

<note place="marg">Caligula.</note>

 meane or other made open rebellion, as Gyldas saith. Wherevpon the emperour Caligula (as some thinke) tooke occasion to leauie a power, and as one vtterie misliking the negligence (as he called it) of Augustus and Tiberius his predecessors, he ment not onlie to reduce the Iland vnto the former subiection, but also to search out the vttermost bounds thereof, to the behoofe of himselfe, and of the Romane monarchie.</p>
<p>Great prouision therefore was made by the said Caligula to performe that noble enterprise, and this was in the fourth yeere of his reigne. The like preparation was made on the other side by Guiderius, to resist the forren enimies, so that hauing all things in a readinesse, he ceassed not dailie to looke for the comming of the emperour, whome he ment to receiue 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>D n</unclear> Cassius lib.</emph> 59.</note>

 with hard enterteinment if he durst aduenture to set toward Britaine. But see the sequele: the maine armie being thus in a readinesse, departed from Rome in the 79 yeere after the building of the citie, and marching foorth, at length came vnto the Belgike shore, from whence <pb n="481"/>they might looke ouer, and behold the cliffes and coast of Britaine, which Caligula and his men stood gazing vpon with great admiration and woonder.</p>
<p>Furthermore he caused them to stand in battell arraie vpon the coast, where he heard how the Britains were in a redinesse to withstand his entrance. But entring into his gallie, as nothing discouraged with these newes, he rowed a flight shot or two from the shore, and forthwith returned, and then going vp into an high place like a pulpit, framed and set vp there for the nonce, he gaue the token to fight vnto his souldiers by sound of trumpet, and therewith was ech man charged to gather cockle shells vpon the shore, which he called the spoile of the Ocean, and caused them to be laid vp vntill a time conuenient. With the 

<note place="marg">The spoile of the Ocean.</note>

 atchiuing of this exploit (as hauing none other wherewith to beautifie his triumph) he s*entity*emed greatlie exalted, thinking that now he had subdued the whole Ocean, and therefore highlie rewarded his souldiers for their paines susteined in that collection of cockle shells, as if they had doone him some notable p*entity*ece of seruice. He also caried of the same shells with him to Rome, to the end he might there boast of his voyage, and brag how well he had sped; and required therefore verie earnestlie haue of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sic.</emph></note>

 a triumph decreed vnto him for the accomplishment of this enterprise.</p>
<p>But when he saw the senat grudge at the free *entity* liberall granting of a grace in that behalfe, and perceiued how they refused to attribute diuine honors vnto him, in recompense of so foolish an enterprise, it wanted little that he had not slaine them euerie one. From thence therefore he went vp into a throne or royall seate, and calling therewith the common people about him, he told them a long tale what aduentures had chanced to him in his conquest of the Ocean. And when he had perceiued them to shout and crie, as if they had consented that he should haue b*entity*ene a god for this his great trauell and valiant prowesse, he to increase their clamour; caused great quantities of gold *entity* siluer to be scattered amongst them, in the gathering whereof, manie were pressed to death, and diuers also slaine with the inuenomed caltrops of iron, which he did cast out with the same monie, of purpose to doo mischiefe, the same caltrops being in forme small *entity* sharp, so that by reason of the prease of people, much hurt was doone by them yer they were perceiued. And this was the end of the ridiculous voiage of Caligula attempted against the Britains.</p>
<p>But after the death of this Caligula, the emperour Claudius (as Suetonius saith) moued 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sustonius.</emph></note>

 warre against the Britains, because of a sturre and rebellion raised in that land, for that such fugitiues as were fled from thence, were not againe restored when request was made for the same.</p>
<p>Dion Cassius writeth, that one Bericus, being expelled out of Britaine, persuaded the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassius,</emph></note>

 emperour Claudius to take the warre in hand at this time against the Britains, so that one Aulus Plautius a senatour, and as then pretor, was appointed to take the armie that soiourned in France then called Gallia, and to passe ouer with the same into Britaine. The souldiers hearing of this voiage, were loth to go with him, as men not willing to make warre in another world: and therefore delaied time, till at length one Narcissus was sent from Claudius, as it were to appease the souldiers, *entity* procure them to set forward. But when this Narcissus went vp into the tribunall throne of Plautius, to declare the cause of his comming, the souldiers taking great indignation therewith cried, <emph>O Saturnalia,</emph> as if they should haue celebrated their feast daie so called.</p>
<p>When the seruants apparelled in their maisters robes, represented the roome of their maisters, and were serued by them, as if they had b*entity*ene their seruants, and thus at length constreined, through verie shame, they agr*entity*ed to follow Plautius. Herevpon being embarked, he diuided his nauie into thr*entity*e parts, to the end that if they were kept off from arriuing in one place, yet they might take land in another. The ships suffered some impeachment in their passage by a contrarie wind that droue them backe againe: but yet the marriners and men of warre taking good courage vnto them, the rather because there was s*entity*ene a fierie leame to shoot out of the east towards the west, which way their course lay, made forwards againe with their ships, and landed without finding anie resistance. For the <pb n="482"/>Britains looked not for their comming: wherefore, when they heard how their enimies were on land, they got them into the woods and marishes, trusting that by lingering of time the Romans would be constreined to depart, as it had chanced in time past to Iulius Cesar aforesaid,</p>

<p>NOW Plautius had much adoo to find out the Britains in their lurking holes and couerts; howbeit when he had traced them out, first he vanquished Cataratacus, and after Togodumnus the sonnes of Cynobellinus: for their father was dead not verie long before. These therefore fl*entity*eing their waies, Plautus receiued part of the people called 

<note place="marg">Bodumni. Catuellani.</note>

 Bodumni (which were subiects vnto them that were called Catuellani into the obeisance of the Romans: and so leauing there a garrison of souldiors, passed further till he came to a riuer which could not well be passed without a bridge: wherevpon the Britains tooke small regard to defend the passage, as though they had b*entity*ene sure inough But Plautius appointed a certeine number of Germans which he had there with him (being vsed to swim ouer riuers although neuer so swift) to get ouer, which they did, sleaing and wounding the Britains horsses, which were fastened to their wagons or chariots so that the Britains were not able to doo anie p*entity*ece of their accustomed seruice with the same.</p>
<p>Herewithall was Flauius Vespasianus (that afterwards was emperour) with his brother Sabinus sent ouer that riuer, which being got to the further side, slue a great number of the enimies. The residue of the Britains fled, but the next day proffered a new battell in the which they fought so stoutlie, that the victorie depended long in doubtfull balance, till Caius Sidius Geta being almost at point to be taken, did so handle the matter, that the Britains finallie were put to flight: for the which his valiant dooings, triumphant honors were bestowed vpon him, although he was no consull.</p>
<p>The Britains after this battell, withdrew to the riuer of Thames, n*entity*ere to the place where <pb n="483"/>it falleth into the sea, and knowing the shallowes and firme places thereof easilie passed ouer to the further side, whom the Romans following, through lacke of knowledge in the nature of the places, they fell into the marish grounds, and so came to lose manie of their men, namelie of the Germans, which were the first that passed ouer the riuer to follow the Britains, partlie by a bridge which lay within the countrie ouer the said riuer, and partlie by swimming, and other-such shift as they presentlie made.</p>
<p>The Britains hauing lost one of their rulers, namelie Togodumnus (of whom ye haue 

<note place="marg">Togodumnus.</note>

 heard before) were nothing discouraged, but rather more egerlie set on reuenge. Plautius perceiuing their fiercenesse, went no further, but staid and placed garrisons in steeds where n*entity*ed required, to keepe those places which he had gotten, and with all sp*entity*ed sent aduertisement vnto Claudius, according to that he had in commandement, if anie vrgent necessitie should so mooue him. Claudius therefore hauing all things before hand in a readinesse, straightwaies vpon the receiuing of the aduertisement, departed from Rome, and came by water vnto Ostia, and from thence vnto Massilia, and so through France sped his iournies till he came to the side of the Ocean sea, and then imbarking himselfe with his people, passed ouer into Britaine, and came to his armie which abode his comming n*entity*ere the Thames side, where being ioined, they passed the riuer againe, fought with the Britains in a pitcht field, and getting the victorie, tooke the towne of Camelodunum (which some count to be Colchester) being the chiefest citie apperteining vnto Cynobelinus. He reduced also manie other people into his subiection, some by force, and some by surrender, whereof her was called oftentimes by the name of emperour, which was against the ordinance of the Romans: for it was not lawfull for anie to take that name vpon him oftener than once in anie one voiage Moreouer, Claudius tooke from the Britains their armor and weapons, and committed the gouernment of them vnto Plautius, commanding him to endeuour himself to subdue the residues.</p>
<p>Thus hauing brought vnder a part of Britaine, and hauing made his abode therin not

<p>Gyldas also writing of this reuolting of the Britains, saith thus: When information thereof was giuen to the senate, and that hast was made with a sp*entity*edie armie to reuenge <pb n="484"/>the same, there was no warlike nauie prepared in the sea to fight valiantlie for the defense of the countrie, no square battell, no right wing, nor anie other prouision appointed on the shore to be s*entity*ene, but the backes of the Britains in stead of a shield are shewed to the persecutors, and their necks readie to be cut off with the sword through cold feare running through their bones, which stretched foorth their hands to be bound like womanlie creatures; so that a common prouerbe followed thereof, to wit, That the Britains were neither valiant in warre, nor faithfull in peace: and so the Romans sleaing manie of the rebels, reseruing some, and bringing them to bondage, that the land should not lie altogither vntilled and desert, returned into Italie out of that land which was void of wine and oile, leauing some of their men there for gouernors to chastise the people, not so much with an armie of men, as with scourge and whip, and if the matter so required, to applie the naked sword vnto their sides: so that it might be accounted Rome and not Britaine. And what coine either of brasse, siluer or gold there was, the same to be stamped with the image of the emperour." Thus farre Gildas.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon. Matth. West.</emph></note>

<p>In the British historie we find other report as thus, that Claudius at his comming aland at Porchester, besieged that towne, to the rescue whereof came Guiderius, and giuing battell to the Romans, put them to the woorse, till at length one Hamo, being on the Romans side, changed his shield and armour, apparelling himselfe like a Britaine, and so entring into the thickest prease of the British host, came at length where the king was, and there slue him. But Aruiragus perceiuing this mischiefe, to the end the Britains should not be discouraged therewith, caused himselfe to be adorned with the kings cote-armor, and other abiliments, and so as king continued the fight with such manhood, that the Romans were put to flight. Claudius retired backe to his ships, and Hamo to the next woods, whom Aruiragus pursued, and at length droue him vnto the sea side, and there slue him yer he could take the hauen which was there at hand; so that the same tooke name of him, and was called a long time after, Hamons hauen, and at length by corruption of speach it was

 against him: in so much that when Claudius had renewed his force and woone Porchester, and after came to besiege Winchester (in the which Aruiragus as then was inclosed) Aruiragus assembling his power, was readie to come foorth and giue Claudius battell: wherevpon Claudius doubting the sequele of the thing, sent messengers vnto Aruiragus to treat of concord, and so by composition the matter was taken vp, with condition, that Claudius should giue his daughter Genissa in marriage vnto Aruiragus, *entity* Aruiragus should acknowledge to hold his kingdome of the Romans.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ramulfus Cestrenris.</emph></note>

<p>Some write that Claudius in fauour of the valiant prowesse which he saw *entity* found in <pb n="485"/>Aruiragus, honored not onlie him with the mariage of his daughter the said Genissa, but also to the end to make the towne more famous where this marriage was solemnized, he therefore called it Claudiocestria, after his name, the which in the British toong was called before that daie Caerleon, and after Glouernia, of a duke that ruled in Demetia that hight Glunie, but now it is called Glocester.</p>
<p>Other there be that write, how Claudius being vanquished in battell by Aruiragus, was compelled by the said Aruiragus to giue vnto him his said daughter to wife, with condition as bfore is mentioned: and that then Aruiragus was crowned king of Britaine. But Suetonius maie s*entity*eme to reprooue this part of the British historie, which in the life of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sueton.</emph></note>

 Claudius witnesseth, that he had by thr*entity*e wiues onlie three daughters, that is to saie, Claudia, Antonia, and Octauia: and further, that reputing Claudia not to be his, caused hir to be cast downe at the doore of his wife Herculanilla, whome he had forsaken by waie of diuorcement: *entity* that he bestowed his daughter Antonia first on C.

Whereby it should app*entity*ere, that this supposed marriage betwixt Aruiragus and the daughter of Claudius is but a feined tale.</p>
<p>*entity* And h*entity*ere to speake my fansie also what I thinke of this Aruiragus, and other the kings (whome Galfrid and such as haue followed him doo register in order, to succ*entity*ed one after another) I will not denie but such persons there were, and the same happilie bearing verie great rule in the land, but that they reigned as absolute kings ouer the whole, or that they succ*entity*eded one after another in manner as is auouched by the same writers, it seemeth most vnlike to be true: for rather it maie be gessed by that, which as well Gyldas as the old approoued Romane writers haue written, that diuerse of these kings liued about one time, or in times greatlie differing from those times which in our writers we find noted. As for example, Iuuenal maketh this Aruiragus of whom we now intreat, to reigne about Domitians time. For my part therefore, sith this order of the British kinglie succession in this place is more easie to be flatlie denied and vtterlie reprooued, than either wiselie defended or trulie amended, I will referre the reforming therof vnto those that haue perhaps s*entity*ene more than I haue, or more d*entity*epelie considered the thing, to trie out an vndoubted truth: in the meane time, I haue thought good, both to shew what I find in our histories, and likewise in forren writers, to the which we thinke (namelie in this behalfe, whilest the Romans gouerned there) we maie safelie giue most credit, doo we otherwise neuer so much content our selues with other vaine and fond conceits.</p>
<p>To proc*entity*ed yet with the historie as we find it by our writers set foorth: it is reported, that after the solemnization of this marriage, which was doone with all honour that might

 to the Romans. Wherevpon Claudius appointed Vespasian with an armie to go as lieutenant into Britaine. This iournie was to him the beginning of his aduancement to that honour, which after to him most luckilie befell. But if we shall credit our Britaine writers, he gained not much at Aruiragus hands, for where he would haue landed at Sandwich or Richborough, Aruiragus was readie to resist him, so as he durst not once enter the hauen: for Aruiragus had there such a puissant number of armed men, that the Romans were afraid to approach the land.</p>
<p>Vespasian therefore withdrew from thence, and coasting westward, landed at Totnesse and comming to Excester, besieged that citie: but about the seuenth day after he had planted his siege, came Aruiragus, and gaue him battell, in the which both the armies susteined great losse of men, and neither part got anie aduantage of the other.

<p>IN the daies of the said Aruiragus, about the yeare of Christ 53, Ioseph of Arimathia, who buried the bodie of our sauiour, being sent by Philip the Apostle (as Iohn Bale following the authoritie of Gildas and other British writers reciteth) after that the Christians were dispersed out of Gallia, came into Britaine with diuers other godlie christian men, *entity*

<p>Nicephorus writeth in his second booke and fourth chapter, that one Simon Zelotes came likewise into Britaine. And Theodoretus in his 9. booke "De curandis Graecorum affectibus," sheweth that Paule being released of his second imprisonment, and suffered to depart from Rome, preached the gospell to the Britains and to other nations in the west. The same thing in manner dooth Sophronius the patriarch of Ierusalem witnesse. Tertullian also maie be a witnesse of the ancientnes of the faith receiued here in Britaine, where he writing of these times saith: Those places of the Britains, to the which the Romans could not approch, were subiect vnto Christ, as were also the countries of Sarmatia, Dacia, Germania, Scithia, and others, *entity* Thus it maie appeare, that the christian religion was planted here in this land shortlie after Christes time, although it certeinlie appeareth not who were the first that preached the gospell to the Britains, nor whether they were Gr*entity*eks or Latins.</p>

 thought a new lieutenant, with an armie to, him vnacquainted and come ouer now in the beginning of winter, would not be hastie to march foorth against them. But Ostorius vnderstanding that by the first successe and chance of warre, feare or hope is bred and augmented, hasted forward to encounter with them, and such as he found abroad in the countrie he slue out right on euerie side, and pursued such as fled, to the end they should not come togither againe. Now for that a displeasing and a doubtfull peace was not like to bring quietnesse either to him or to his armie, he tooke from such as he suspected, their armour. And after this, he went about to defend the riuers of Auon *entity* Seuerne, with placing his souldiers in camps fortified n*entity*ere to the same. But the Oxfordshire men and other of those parties would not suffer him to accomplish his purpose in anie quiet sort, being a puissant kind of people, and not hitherto weakened by warres: for they willinglie at the first had ioined in amitie with the Romans. The countries adioining also being induced

 by their procurement, came to them, *entity* so they chose forth a plot of ground, fensed with a mightie ditch, vnto the which there was no waie to enter but one, *entity* the same verie narrow, so as the horssemen could not haue anie easie passage to breake in vpon them. Ostorius, although he had no legionarie souldiers, but certeine bands of aids, marched foorth towards the place within the which the Britains were lodged, and assaulting them in the same, brake through into their campe, where the Britains being impeached with their owne inclosures which they had raised for defense of the place, knowing how that for their rebellion they were like to find small mercie at the Romans hands, when they saw now no waie to escape, laid about them manfullie, and shewed great proofe of their valiant stomachs.</p>
<p>In this battell, the sonne of Ostorius the lieutenant deserued the price and commendation 

<note place="marg">which was a certaine crowne, to be set on his head called <emph>ciuica corona.</emph></note>

 of preseruing a citizen out of the cruell enimies hands. But now with this slaughter of the Oxfordshire men, diuers of the Britains that stood doubtfull what waie to take, either to rest in quiet, or to moue warres, were contented to be conformable vnto a reasonable order of peace, in so much that Ostorius lead his armie against the people called Cangi, who inhabited 

<note place="marg">Cangi.</note>

 that part of Wales now called Denbighshire, which countrie he spoiled on euerie side, no enimie once daring to encounter him: *entity* if anie of them aduentured priuilie to set vpon those which they found behind, or on the outsids of his armie, they were cut short yer they could escape out of danger. Wherevpon he marched straight to their campe and giuing them battell, vanquished them: and vsing the victorie as reason moued him, he lead <pb n="488"/>his armie against those that inhabited the inner parts of Wales, spoiling the countrie on euerie side. And thus sharplie pursuing the rebels, he approched n*entity*ere vnto the sea side, which lieth ouer against Ireland. While this Romane capteine was thus occupied, he was called backe by the rebellion of the Yorkshire men, whome forthwith vpon his comming vnto them, he appeased, punishing the first authors of that tumult with death. </p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Cor. Tacitus. lib.</emph> 12.</note>

<p>In the meane time, the people called Silures, being a verie fierce kind of men, and valiant, prepared to make warre against the Romans, for they might not be bowed neither with roughnesse, nor yet with any courteous handling, so that they were to be tamed by an armie of legionarie souldiers to be brought among them.</p>
<p>Therefore to restraine the furious rage of those people and their neighbours, Ostorious peopled a towne n*entity*ere to their borders, called Camelodunum with certeine bands of old souldiers, there to inhabit with their wiues and children, according to such maner as was vsed in like cases of placing naturall Romans in anie towne or citie, for the more suertie and defense of the same. Here also was a temple builded in the honor of Claudius the emperour, where were two images erected, one of the goddesse Victoria, and an other of Claudius himselfe,</p>
	</div2>

<div2 type="chapter" n="6">
<head type="title"> The coniectures of writers touching the situation of Camelodunum supposed to be Colckester, of the Silures a people spoken of in the former chapter, a foughten field betwene Caratacus the British prince, and Ostorius the Romaine, in the confines of Shropshire; the Britains go miserablie to wracke, Caratacus is deliuered to the Romans, his wife and daughter are taken prisoners, his brethren yeeld themselues to their enimies.</head>
<head type="unitnum">The Sixt Chapter.</head>
<p>BUT now there resteth a great doubt among writers, where this citie or towne called Camelodunum did stand, of some (and not without good ground of probable conjectures gathered vpon the aduised consideration of the circumstances of that which in old authors is 

<note place="marg">camelodunum, Colchester.</note>

 found written of this place) it is thought to be Colchester. But verelie by this place of Tacitus it maie rather seeme to be some other towne, situat more westward than Colchester, sith a colonie of Romane souldiers were planted there to be at hand, for the repressing of the 

<note place="marg">Silures where they inhabited,</note>

 vnquiet Silures, which by consent of most writers inhabited in Southwales, or n*entity*ere the Welsh marshes.</p>
<p>There was a castell of great fame in times past that hight Camaletum, or in British Caermalet, which stood in the marshes of Summersetshire: but sith there is none that hath so written before this time, I will not saie that happilie some error hath growne by mistaking the name of Camelodunum for this Camaletum, by such as haue copied out the booke of Cornelius Tacitus; and yet so it might be doon by such as found it short or vnperfectlie written, namelie, by such strangers or others, to whom onelie the name of Camelodunum was onelie knowne, and Camaletum peraduenture neuer s*entity*ene nor heard of. As for example, an Englishman that hath heard of Waterford in Ireland, and not of Wexford, might in taking foorth a copie of some writing easilie commit a fault in noting the one for the other. We find in Ptolomie Camedolon to be a cite belonging to the Trinobants, and he maketh mention also of Camelodunum, but Humfrey Lhoyd thinketh that he meaneth all one citie.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Polydor Virgil is of a contrarie opinion, supposing the one to be Colchester in d*entity*ed, and the other that is Camelodunum to be Doncaster or Pontfret. Leland esteeming it to be certeinelie Colchester taketh the Iceni men also to be the Northfolke men. But howsoeuer we shall take this place of Tacitus, it is euident inough that Camelodunum stood not farre from the Thames. And therefore to s*entity*eke it with Hector Boetius <pb n="489"/>in Scotland, or with Polydor Virgil so far as Doncaster or Pontfret, it male be thought a plaine error.</p>
<p>But to leaue each man to his owne iudgement in a matter so doubtfull, we will proc*entity*ed with the historie as touching the warres betwixt the Romans and the Silurians, against whome (trusting not onelie vpon their owne manhood, but also vpon the high prowesse *entity* valiancie of Caratacus) Ostorius set forward; Caratacus excelled in fame aboue all other the princes 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cornelius Tacrtus lib. dnna.</emph> 12.</note>

 of Britaine, aduanced thereto by manie doubtfull aduentures and manie prosperous exploits, which in his time he had atchiued: but as he was in policie and aduantage of place better prouided than the Romans: so in power of souldiers he was ouermatched. And therefore he remoued the battell into the parts of that countrie where the Ordouices inhabited, which 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hu. Lhoyd.</emph></note>

 are thought to haue dwelled in the borders of Shropshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire, which people together with other that misliked of the Romane gouernment, he ioined in one, and chose a plot of ground for his aduantage, determining there to trie the vttermost hazard of battell.</p>
<p>The place which he thus chose was such, as the entries, the backwaies, and the whole situation thereof made for the Britains aduantage, and cleane contrarie to the Romans, as inclosed among high hils. And if there were anie easie passage to enter it vpon anie side, the same was shut vp with mightie huge stones in manner of a rampire, and afore it there ran a riuer without anie certeine foord to passe ouer it. This place is supposed to lie in the confines of Shropshire aloft vpon the top of an high hill there, enuironed with a triple rampire and ditch of great depth, hauing thr*entity*e entries into it, not directlie one against an other, but aslope. It is also (they saie) compassed about with two riuers, to wit, on the left hand with the riuer called Clun, *entity* on the right hand with an other called Teuid. On thr*entity*e sides thereof the clime is verie steepe and headlong, and no waie easie to come or reach vnto it, but onelie one.</p>
<p>Caratac hauing thus fortified himselfe within this place, and brought his armie into it: to encourage his people, he exhorted them to shew their manhood, affirming that to be the day, and that armie to be the same wherein should appeare the beginning either of libertie then to be recouered, or else of perpetuall bondage for euer to be susteined. He rehersed also speciallie by name those their elders, which had resisted Iulius Cesar, by whose high valiancie they liued free from the bloudie thraidome and tributes of the Romans, and enioied their wiues and children safe and vndefiled. Thus discoursing of manie things with them, in such hope of assured victorie, that they began to raise their cries, each one for him selfe, declaring that he was bound by the dutie he owght to the gods of his countries not to shrinke for feare of anie wounds or hurts that might chance vnto them by the enimies weapon.</p>
<p>This ch*entity*erefulnesse of the Britains greatlie astonished the Romane lieutenant. The hideous course also of the riuer before his face, the fortifications and craggie higth of the hils, all set full of enimies readie to beat him backe, put him in great feare: for nothing he saw afore him, but that which s*entity*emed dreadfull to those that should assaile. But the souldiers yet s*entity*emed to be verie desirous of battell, requesting him to bring them to it, protesting that nothing was able to resist the force of noble prowes. Herewith the capteins and tribunes discoursing the like, pricked forward the earnest willes which their souldiers had to fight.</p>
<p>Ostorius perceiuing such courage and readie wils in the men of warre, as well souldiers as capteins, began to bestirre himselfe, and left nothing vndone that might serue to set forward their earnest desire to battell. And hauing aduisedlie considered which waies were hard and vnpossible to be entered vpon, and which were most easie for his people to find passage by, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cornelius Tacitus Annal. lib.</emph> 12.</note>

 he led them foorth, being most earnestlie bent to cope with the enimie.</p>
<p>Now hauing passed the water without any great difficultie but comming to the rampire, he lost manie of his people, so long as the fight was continued with shot and casting of darts: but after that the Romans couering themselues with their targets, came once close togither, and approched vnder the rampire, they remooued away the stones which the Britains had <pb n="490"/>roughlie couched togither, and so came to ioine with them at handblowes. The Britains being vnarmed, and not able to abide the force of the armed men, withdrew to the top of the hilles, but as well their enimies that were light armed, as the other with heauie armour followed and brake in among them, so as the Britains could not turne them anie way to escape, for the light armed men with shot a farre off, and the heauie armed with weapons at hand, sought to make slaughter and wracke of them on ech side, so that this was a verie dolefull day to the Britains,</p>
<p>The wife and daughter of Caratake were taken prisoners, and his brethren also y*entity*elded themselues. He himselfe escaped, and committing his person vnto the assurance *entity* trust of Cartemandua queene of the Brigants, was by hir deliuered into the hands of the Romans.

My present estate as it is to me reprochfull, so to you it is honorable. I had at commandement, horsses, men, armor, and great riches; what maruell is it if I were loth to forgo the same?

<p>The emperour with these words being pacified, granted life both to Caratake, and also to his wife and brethren, who being loosed from their bands, went also to the place where the <pb n="491"/>empresse Agrippina sat (not farre off) in a chaire of estate, whom they reuerenced with the like praise and thanks as they had doone before to the emperour. After this the senat was called togither, who discoursed of manie things touching this honourable victorie atchiued by the taking of Caratake, est*entity*eming the same no lesse glorious, than when P. Scipio shewed in triumph Siphax king of the Numidians, or L. Paulus the Macedonian king Perses, or other

 Romane capteins anie such king whom they had vanquished.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon it was determined, that Ostorius should enter the citie of Rome with triumph like a conqueror, for such prosperous successe as hitherto had followed him: but afterwards his proc*entity*edings were not so luckie, either for that after Caratake was remooued out of the waie, or bicause the Romans (as though the warre had b*entity*ene finished) looked negligentlie to themselues, either else for that the Britains taking compassion of the miserable state of Caratake, being so worthie a prince, through fortunes froward aspect cast into miserie, were more earnestlie set to reuenge his quarrell. H*entity*erevpon they incompassed the maister of the campe, and those legionarie bands of souldiers which were left amongst the Silures to fortifie a place there for the armie to lodge in: and if succour had not come out of the next towns and castels, the Romans had b*entity*ene destroied by siege. The head capteine yet, and eight centurions, and euerie one else of the companies being most forward, were slaine. Shortlie after they set vpon the Romane forragers, and put them to flight, and also such companies of horssemen as were appointed to gard them. H*entity*erevpon Ostorius set foorth certeine bands of light horssemen, but neither could he stale the flight by that meanes, till finallie the legions entred the battell, by whose force they were staid, and at length the Romans obteined the better: but the Britains escaped by flight without great losse, by reason the daie was spent.</p>
<p>After this, manie bickerings chanced betwixt the Britains and Romans, *entity* oftentimes they wrought their feats more like the trade of them that vse to rob by the high waies, than of those that make open warre, taking their enimies at some aduantage in woods and bogs, as hap or force ministred occasion vpon malice conceiued, or in hope of prey, sometimes by commandement, and sometimes without either commandement or knowledge of capteine or officer.</p>
<p>At one time the Britains surprised two bands of footmen that were with the Romans in aid, and sent foorth to forreie abroad vnaduisedlie, through couetousnesse of the capteins. This feat was atchiued by the Silures also, the which in bestowing prisoners and part of the spoile vpon other of their neighbours, procured them likewise to rebell against the Romans, and to take part with them. The Silures were the more earnestlie set against the Romans, by occasion of words which the emperor Claudius had vttered in their disfauour, as thus: that euen as the Sicambres were destroied and remooued into Gallia, so likewise must the Silures be dealt with, and the whole nation of them extinguished. These words being blowne abroad, and knowne ouer all, caused the Silures to conceiue a woonderfull hatred against the Romans, so that they were fullie bent, either to reteine their libertie, or to die in defense thereof vpon the enimies swoord.</p>
<p>In the meane time Ostorius Scapula departed this life, a right noble warrior, and one who by litle *entity* litle insuing the steps of Aulus Plautius his predecessor, did what he could to bring the Ile into the forme of a prouince, which in part he accomplished.</p>
<p>There be some led by coniecture grounded vpon good aduised considerations, that suppose 

<note place="marg"><emph>W. H.</emph> in his chronologie</note>

 this Ostorius Scapula began to build the citie of Chester after the ouerthrow of Caratacus: for in those parties he fortified sundrie holds, and placed a number of old souldiers either there in that selfe place, or in n*entity*ere therevnto by waie of a colonie. And for somuch (saie they) as we read of none other of anie name thereabouts, it is to be thought that he planted the same in Chester, where his successors did afterwards vse to harbour their legions for the winter season, and in time of rest from iournies which they haue to make against their common enimies.</p>
<p>In d*entity*ed it is a common opinion among the people there vnto this daie, that the Romans built those vaults or tauerns (which in that citie are vnder the ground) with some part of the 
<pb n="492"/>castell.

 And verelie as Ranulfe Higden saith, a man that shall view and well consider those buildings, male thinke the same to be the woorke of Romans rather than of anie other people. That the Romane legions did make their abode there, no man s*entity*ene in antiquities can doubt thereof, for the ancient name <emph>Caer leon ardour deuy,</emph> that is, The citie of legions vpon the water of D*entity*e, proueth it sufficientlie enough.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Corn. Tacit.</emph></note>

<p>But to returne vnto Ostorius Scapula, we find in Corn. Tacitus, that during his time of

 being lieutenant in this Ile, there were certeine cities giuen vnto one Cogidune a king of the Britains, who continued faithfull to the Romans vnto the daies of the remembrance of men liuing in the time of the said Cornelius Tacitus, who liued and wrote in the emperor Domitianus time. This was doone after an old receiued custom of the people of Rome, to haue both subiects and kings vnder their rule and dominion, as who so shall note the acts and d*entity*eds of the Roman emperours from C. Iulius Caesar (who chased Pompeie out of Italie, and was the first that obteined the Romane empire to himselfe; of whom also the princes and emperours succ*entity*eding him were called Cesars) to Octauian, Tiberius, Caligula, *entity*c: maie easilie marke and obserue.

<note place="marg">A. Didius lieutenant.</note>

<p>AFTER the deceasse of Ostorius Scapula, one A Didius was sent to supplie his roome, but yer he could come, things were brought out of order, and the Britains had vanquished the legion whereof Manlius Valens had the conduct: this victorie was set foorth by the Britains to the vttermost, that with the bruit thereof they might strike a feare into the lieutenants hart, now vpon his first comming ouer. And he himselfe reported it by letters to the emperour after the largest manner, to the end that if he appeased the matter, he might win the more praise; or if he were put to the woorst, and should not preuaile, that then his excuse might s*entity*eme the more reasonable and woorthie of pardon. The Silures were they that had atchiued this victorie, and kept a fowle stur ouer all the countries about them, till by the comming of Didius against them, they were driuen backe and repelled.</p>
<p>But h*entity*erewith began trouble to be raised in another part: for after that Caratac was 

<note place="marg">Venutius tuler of the lngants.</note>

 taken, the chiefest and most skillfull capteine which the Britains had, was one Venutius, a ruler of the people named Iugants, a man that remained a long time faithfull to the Romans, 

<note place="marg">Cartimanda</note>

 and by their power was defended from his enimies, who had married with Cartimanda queene of the Brigants or Yorkeshire men. This Cartimanda (as ye haue heard) had deliuered Catarac into the Romans hands, thereby ministring matter for the emperour Claudius to triumph, by which pleasure shewed to the Romans, she increased thorough their friendship in power and wealth, whereof followed riotous lust to satisfie hir wanton appetite, so as she 

<note place="marg">Vellocatus.</note>

 falling at square with hir husband, married Vellocatus, one of his esquires, to whom she gaue hir kingdome, and so dishonoured hir selfe. H*entity*erevpon insued cruell warre, in so, much that in the end Venutius became enimie also to the Romans. But first they tugged togither betwixt themselues, *entity* the qu*entity*ene by a craftie policie found meanes to catch the brother and coosens of Venutius, but hir enimies nothing therewith discouraged, but kindled the more in wrath against hir, ceassed not to go forward with their purpose.</p>

<pb n="493"/>
<p>Manie of the Brigants disdaining to be subiect vnto a womans rule that had so reiected hir husband, reuolted vnto Venutius: but yet the qu*entity*enes sensuall lust mixed with crueltie, mainteined the adulterer. Venutius therefore calling to him such aid as he could get, and strengthened now by the reuolting of the Brigants, brought Cartimanda to such a narrow point, that she was in great danger to fall into the hands of hir enimies: which the Romans fors*entity*eing, vpon suit made, sent certeine bands of horssemen and footmen to helpe hir. They had diuerse incounters with the enimies at the first, with doubtfull successe: but at 

<note place="marg">Venutius kecpeth the kingdome in despite of the Romans</note>

 length they preuailed, and so deliuered the qu*entity*ene out of perill, but the kingdome remained to Venutius: against whom the Romans were constreined still to mainteine warre.</p>
<p>About the same time, the legion also which Cesius Nasica led, got the vpper hand of those Britains against whom he was sent. For Didius being aged, and by victories past inough renowmed, thought it sufficient for him to make warre by his capteins, so to stale and k*entity*epe off the enimie. Certeine castels and holds in d*entity*ed he caused to be built and fortified, further within the countrie than had b*entity*ene afore attempted by anie of his predecessors, and so thereby were the confines of the Romans in this Ile somewhat inlarged. Thus haue ye heard with what successe the Britains mainteined warre in defense of their libertie against the Romans, whilest Claudius ruled the empire (according to the report of the Romane writers.)</p>
<p>*entity* But here you must note, that Hector Boetius, following the authoritie of one Veremond 

<note place="marg">The error of <emph>Hector Boetius.</emph></note>

 a Spaniard, of Cornelius Hibernicus, *entity* also of Campbell, remooueth the Silures, Brigants, and Nouants, so farre northward, that he maketh them inhabitants of those countries which the Scots haue now in possession, and were euen then inhabited (as he affirmeth) partlie by the Scots, and partlie by the Picts (as in the Scotish historie ye may s*entity*e more at large) so that what notable feat soeuer was atchiued by the old Britains against the Romans, the same by him is ascribed to the Scots and Picts throughout his whole historie, whereas (in verie truth) forsomuch as may be gathered by coniecture und presumption of that which is left in writing by ancient authors, the Brigants inhabited Yorkshire, the Silures Wales and the Marches, and the Nouants the countrie of Cumberland.</p>
<p>But forsomuch as he hath diligentlie gathered in what maner the warres were mainteined by those people against the Romans, and what valiant exploits were taken in hand and finished thorough their stoutnesse and valiancie, ye may there read the same, and iudge at your

Didius Gallus (whom in this place Cornelius Tacitus calleth Auitus) could during the time of his rule doo no more but hold that which was alreadie gotten, beside the building of certeine castels (as before ye haue heard) neither his successor Verannius, beating and forreieng the woods, could atchiue anie further enterprise, for he was by death preuented, so as he could not proc*entity*ed forward with his purpose touching the warres which he had ment to haue folowed, whose last words (in his testament expressed) detected him of manifest ambition: for adding manie things by way of flatterie to content Neros mind, he wished to haue liued but two y*entity*eres longer, in which space he might haue subdued prouinces vnto his dominion, meaning therby the whole Ile of Britaine.

<p>BUT now when this great losse chanced to the Romans Paulinus Suetonius did gouerne

<note place="marg">Anglesey inuaded.</note>
the Britains as kept out, prepared to assaile the Ile of Anglesey, a countrie full of inhabitants,
and a place of refuge for all outlawes and rebels. He builded certeine brigantins with flat
keeles to serue for the ebbes and shallow shelues here and there, lieng vncerteinlie in the
straits which he had to passe. The footmen ferried ouer in those vessels, the horssemen
following by the foords, and swimming when they came into the deepe, got likewise to the
shore, where stood in order of battell and huge number of armed men close togither, redie
<note place="marg">A strange maner of women.</note>
to beat backe the Romans, and to staie them from comming to land. Amongst the men,

a number of women were also running vp and downe as they had b*entity*ene out of their wits,
in garments like to wild roges, with their haire hanging downe about their shoulders, and
<note place="marg">The Druids.</note>
bearing firebrands in their hands. There was also a companie of their priests or philosophers
called Druides, who with stretched forth hands towards heauen, thundered out curssings
against the Romans in most bitter wise.</p>

<p>The souldiers were so amazed with the strangenesse of this sight, that (as men benummed
of their lims and senses) they suffred themselues to be wounded and slaine like
senselesse creatures, till by the calling vpon of their generall, and ech one incouraging other
in no wise to feare a sort of mad *entity* distract women, they preassed forward vnder their ensignes,
bearing downe such as stood in their way, and with their owne fire smooldered and
burnt them to ashes.</p>
<note place="marg"> Anglesey won by the Romans.</note>

<p>To conclude, the Romane lieutenant got possession of the whole Ile, wherein he placed
garisons of men of warre to k*entity*epe the people there in subiection. He also caused their
<note place="marg">Woods cut downe.</note>
woods to be cut downe, that were consecrated to their gods, within the which they were accustomed
to sacrifice sush as they tooke prisoners, and by the view of their intrailes, in dismembring
them, to learne of their gods some oracles and such other things as should come
to passe.</p>
<p>But now in the meane time, whilest Paulinus was abroad about this enterprise, the Britains
began to conferre togither of they great and importable miseries, of their grieuous state of
seruitude, of their iniuries and wrongs, which they dailie susteined: how that by sufferance
they profited nothing, but still were oppressed with more heauie burthens.   Ech countrie
<note place="marg">Lieutenant *entity*  procurator.</note>
in times past had onelie one king to rule them: now had they two, the lieutenant by his
capteins and souldiers spilling their bloud, and the procurator   or receiuer (as we may call
him) bereauing them of their goods and substance. The concord or discord betwixt those
that were appointed to rule ouer them, was all alike hurtfull vnto the subiects, the lieutenant
oppressing them by his capteins and men of warre, and the procurator or receiuer by force
and reprochfull demeanours, polling them by insufferable exactions.</p>
<p>There was nothing fr*entity*e from the couetous extortion and filthie concupiscence of these
vnsatiable persons, for in these daies (say they) the greatest spoiler is the valiantest man,
and most commonlie our houses are robbed and ransacked by a sort of cowardlie raskals
that haue no knowledge of anie warlike feats at all. Our children are taken from us, we
are forced to go to the musters, and are set foorth to serue in forren parties, as those that
are ignorant which way to spend our liues in the quarell of our owne countrie. What a
number of souldiers haue beene transported ouer from hence to serue in other lands, if a

<pb n="495"/>
iust account were taken thereof: The Germans by manhood haue cast (said they) from
their shoulders the heauie yoke of bondage, and are not defended as we are with the
maine Ocean sea, but onelie with a riuer. Where the Britains haue their countrie, their
wiues and parents, as iust causes of war to fight for: the Romans haue none at all, but a
couetous desire to gaine by rapine, and to satisfie their excessiue lusts.</p>
<p>They might easilie be compelled to depart the countrie, as Iulius Cesar was, if the Britains
would shew some proofe of the noble prowesse that was euidentlie found in their woorthie
ancestors, and not shrinke or quaile in courage for the misaduenture that should happilie
chance by fighting one battell or two. Greatest force and constancie alwaies remaineth
with those that seek to deliuer themselues from miserie. Now appeared it that the gods
had taken some pitie of the poore Britains, who by their diuine power did withhold the
chiefe capteine of the Romans with his armie, as it were banished in an other Iland. Let

taken aduise togither, and wholie misliking their present state, they determined to take

meane to haue his kingdome and familie preserued from all iniurie: it happened quite contrarie
to that his expectation. For his kingdome was spoiled by the Romane capteins, his

<note place="marg">Voadicia alias Bunduica. </note>
wife named Voadicia beaten by the souldiers, his daughters rauished, the peeres of the
realme bereft of their goods, and the kings friends made and reputed as bondslaues.
<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassius.</emph></note>
There was also an other great cause that stirred the Britains to this rebellion, which was
the confiscating of their goods: for whereas Claudius himselfe had pardoned the chiefest
persons of the forfeitures, Decianus Catus the procurator of that Ile mainteined that the
same ought to be renewed againe. To this an other griefe was added, that where Seneca   Vsurie.
had lent to the nobilitie of the Ile, foure hundred sestercies, ech hundred being 500000
pounds starling, or thereabout, vpon great interest, he required the whole summe togither by
great rigor and violence, although he forced them at the first to take this monie to vsurie.
Also such old souldiers as were placed by waie of a colonie, to inhabit the towne of
Camelodunum, expelled manie of the Britains out of their houses, droue them out of their
possessions and lands, and accounted the Britains as slaues, and as though they had bene
captiue prisoners or bondmen. Besides this, the temple there that was built in honor of
Claudius, as an altar of eternall rule and gouernment, was serued with pr*entity*ests, the which
vnder colour of religion did spoile, consume and deuoure the goods of all men.</p>
<p>Moreouer, such strange sights and woonders as chanced about the same time, pricked the
Britains the rather forward.   For the image of the goddesse Victoria in the temple at


<pb n="496"/>Camelodunum, slipping downe, turned hir backe (as who should saie she gaue place as

<note place="marg">Strange woonders.</note>

 great w*entity*eping and lamentable howling, at such time as it was certeinlie knowne that there was no creature there to make anie noise. The sea at a spring tide appeared of a bloudie colour, and when the tide was gone backe, there were s*entity*ene on the sands the shapes *entity*

<note place="marg">Polydor.</note>

<p>But those things, whether they chanced by the craft of man, or illusion of the diuell; or whether they proc*entity*eded of some naturall cause, which the common people oftentimes taketh superstitiouslie, in place of strange woonders signifieng things to follow, we would let passe, least we might be thought to offend religion; the which teaching all things to be doone by the prouidence of God, despiseth the vaine predictions of haps to come, if the order of an historie (saith Polydor Virgil) would so permit, the which requireth all things to be written in maner as they fall out and come to passe.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Cor. Tac. li.</emph> 15. Voadicia by Dion Cassius is called Bunuica.</note>

<p>But the Britains were chiefelie mooued to rebellion by the lust complaint of Voadicia, declaring how vns*entity*emelie she had beene vsed and intreated at the hands of the Romans: and because she was most earnestlie bent to s*entity*eke reuenge of their iniuries, and hated the name of the Romans most of all other, they chose hir to be capteine (for they in rule and gouernement

 made no difference then of sex, whether they committed the same to man or woman) and so by a generall conspiracie, the more part of the people hauing also allured the Essex men vnto rebellion, rose and assembled themselues togither to make warre against the Romans. There were of them a hundred and twentie thousand got togither in one armie vnder the leading of the said Voadicia, or Bunduica (as some name hir.)</p>
<p>She therefore to encourage hir people against the enimies, mounted vp into an high place raised vp of turfes *entity* sods made for the nonce, out ot the which she made a long *entity* verie pithie oration.

<note place="marg">The oration of Voadicia.</note>

<p>"I doo suppose (my louers and friends) that there is no man here but dooth well vnderstand how much libertie and fr*entity*edome is to be preferred before thraldome and bondage. But if there haue bene anie of you so deceiued with the Romane persuasions, that ye did not for a time see a difference betw*entity*ene them, and iudged whether of both is most to be <pb n="497"/>desired: now I hope that hauing tried what it is to be vnder both, ye wiil with me reforme your iudgement, and by the harmes alreadie taken, acknowledge your ouersight, and forsake your former error. Againe, in that a number of you haue rashlie preferred an externall souereigntie before the customes and lawes o your owne countrie, you doo at this time (I doubt not) perfectlie vnderstand how much free pouertie is to be preferred before great riches, wherevnto seruitude is annexed; and much wealth in respect of captiuitie vnder forren magistrats, wherevpon slauerie attendeth. For what thing (I bes*entity*ech you) can there be so vile *entity* grieuous vnto the nature of man, that hath not happened vnto vs, sithens the time that the Romans haue bene acquainted with this Iland?</p>
<p>"Are we not all in manner bereaued of our riches *entity* possessions? Doo not we (beside other things that we giue, and the land that we till for their onelie profit) paie them all kinds of tributs, yea for our owne carcases? How much better is it to be once aloft and fortunate in deed, than vnder the forged and false title of libertie, continuallie to paie for our redemption a fr*entity*edome? How much is it more commendable to lose our liues in defense of our countrie, than to carie about not so much as our heads toll fr*entity*e, but dailie oppressed *entity* laden with innumerable exactions? But to what end doo I remember and speake of these things, since they will not suffer by death to become fr*entity*e? For what and how much we paie for them that are dead, there is not one here but he dooth well vnderstand. Among other nations such as are brought into seruitude, are alwaies by death discharged of their bondage: onelie to the Romans the dead doo still liue, and all to increaes their commoditie and gaine.</p>
<p>"If anie of vs be without monie (as I know not well how and which way we should come by anie) then are we left naked, *entity* spoiled of that which remaineth in our houses, *entity* we our selues as men left desolate *entity* dead. How shall we looke for better dealing at their hands hereafter, that in the beginning deale so vncourteouslie with vs: since there is no man that taketh so much as a wild beast, but at the first e will cherish it, and with some gentlenesse win it to familiaritie? But we ourselues (to saie the trueth) are authors of our owne mischiefe, which suffered them at the first to set foot within our Iland, and did not by and by driue them backe as we did Caesar, or slue them with our swords when they were yet farre off, and that the aduenturing hither was dangerous: as we did sometime to Augustus and Caligula.</p>
<p>"We therefore that inhabit this hand, which for the quantitie thereof maie well be called a maine, although it be inuironed about with the Ocean sea, diuiding vs from other nations, so that we s*entity*eme to liue vpon an other earth, *entity* vnder a seuerall heauen: we, euen we (I saie) whose name hath b*entity*ene long kept hid from the wisest of them all, are now contemned and troden vnder foot, of them who studie nothings else but how to become lords *entity* haue rule of other men. Wherefore my welbeloued citizens, friendes, and kinsfolkes (for I thinke we are all of kin, since we were borne and dwell in this Ile, and haue one name common to vs all) let vs now, euen now (I saie, because we haue not doone it heretofore, and whilest the remembrance of our ancient libertie remaineth) sticke togither, and performe that thing which dooth perteine to valiant and hardie courages, to the end we maie inioie, not onelie the name of libertie, but also fr*entity*edome it selfe, and thereby leaue our force and valiant acts for an example to our posteritie: for if we which haue beene liberallie and in honest maner brought vp, should vtterlie forget our pristinate felicitie: what may we hope for in those that shall suc*entity*ed vs, and are like to be brought vp in miserie and thraldome?</p>
<p>"I doo not make rehearsall of these things vnfo you, to the end I would prouoke you to mislike of this present estate of things (for well I know you abhorre it sufficientlie alreadie) neither to put you in feare of those things that are likelie to fall hereafter (because you doo feare and s*entity*e them verie well before hand) but to the end I maie giue you heartie thankes and woorthie commendations, for that of your owne accord and meanes you determine so well to prouide for things necessarie (thereby to helpe both me <pb n="498"/>and your selues with willing minds) as men that are nothing in doubt of all the Romane puissance.</p>
<p>"If you consider the number of your enimies, it is not greater than yours: if you regard their strength, they are no stronger than you: and all this dooth easilie app*entity*ere by the bassinets, habergeons, *entity* greiues wherewith you be armed; and also by the walls ditches and trenches that you haue made for your own defense, to k*entity*epe off their excursions, who had rather fight with vs a faire off, than cope *entity* deale with vs at hand strokes as our custome of the warres and martiall discipline dooth require. Wherefore we doo so farre exceed them in force, that in mine opinion, our armie is more strong than stone walls, and one of our targets woorth all the armour that they doo beare vpon them: by meanes whereof, if the victorie be ours, we shall soone make them captiues: or if we lose the field, we shall easilie escape the danger.</p>
<p>"Furthermore if after the flight we shall indeuour to m*entity*et anie where, we haue the marishes h*entity*ere beneath to hide vs in, and the hils round about to k*entity*epe them off, so that by no meanes they shall haue their purpose of vs, whereas they being ouercharged with heavie armour, shall neither be able to follow, if we fl*entity*e; nor escape out of our danger, if they be put to flight: if they happen to breake out at anie time as desirous to make a rode, they returne by and by to their appointed places, where we maie take them as birds alreadie in cage. In all which things, as they are farre inferior to vs, so most of all in this, that they can not indure hunger, thirst, cold, heat, and sunneshine, as we can doo.</p>
<p>"In their houses also and tents, they make much account of their baked meates, wine, oile, and abroad of the shadow, that if anie of these doo faile them, they either die foorthwith, or else in time they languish and consume: whereas to vs euerie hearbe and root is meat, euerie iuice an oile, all water pleasant wine, and euerie tr*entity*e an house. Beside this, there is no place of the land vnknowne to vs, neither yet vnfriendlie to succour vs at n*entity*ed; whereas to the Romans they are for the most part vnknowne and altogither dangerous, if they should stand in n*entity*ed: we can with ease swim ouer euerie riuer both naked and clad, which they with their great ships are scarse able to performe. Wherefore with hope and good lucke let vs set vpon them couragiouslie, and teach them to vnderstand, that since they are no better than hares and foxes, they attempt a wrong match, when they indeuour to subdue the grehounds and the woolues." With which words the qu*entity*ene let an hare go out of hir lap, as it were thereby to giue prognostication of hir successe, which comming well to passe, all the companie showted, and cried out vpon such as not long before had doone such violence to so noble a personage. Presentlie vpon this action, Voadicia calling them togither againe, proc*entity*eded forward with hir praier, which she made before them all, holding vp hir hands after this manner:</p>
<p>"I giue th*entity*e thanks O Adraste, and call vpon thee thou woman of women, which reignest not ouer the burthen-bearing Aegyptians, as Nitocris; neither ouer their merchants, as dooth Semiramis, for these trifles we haue learned latelie of the Romans: neither ouer the people of Rome, as a little h*entity*eretofore Messalina, then Agrippina, and now Nero, who is called by the name of a man, but is in d*entity*ed a verie woman, as dooth app*entity*ere by his voice, his harpe, and his womans attire: but I call vpon thee as a goddesse which gouernest the Britains, that haue learned not to till the field, nor to be handicrafts men, but to lead their liues in the warres after the best manner: who also as they haue all other things, so haue they likewise their wiues and children common, whereby the women haue the like audacitie with the men, and no lesse boldnesse in the warres than they.</p>
<p>"Therefore sithens I haue obteined a kingdome among such a mightie people, I bes*entity*ech th*entity*e to grant them victorie, health, and libertie, against these contentious, wicked, and vn satiable men (if they maie be called men, which vse warme bathings, delicate fare, hot wines, sw*entity*et oiles, soft beds, fine musicke, and so vnkindlie lusts) who are altogither giuen to couetousnesse and crueltie, as their dooings doo declare. Let not I bes*entity*ech th*entity*e, the Neronian or Domitian tyrannie anie more preuaile vpon me, or (to saie truth) vpon <pb n="499"/>th*entity*e, but let them rather serue th*entity*e, whose heauie oppression thou hast borne withall a long season, and that thou wilt still be our helper onlie, our defender, our fauourer, and our furtherer, O noble ladie, I hartilie bes*entity*ech thee."</p>

<p>WHEN Voadicia had made an end of hir praier, she set forward against hir enimies, who at that time were destitute in d*entity*ed of their lieutenant Paulinus Suetonius, being as then in Anglesey (as before ye haue heard.) Wherefore the Romans that were in Camelodunum 

<note place="marg"><emph>Corn. Tacit.</emph> Catus Decianus procurator.</note>

 sent for aid vnto Catus Decianus the procurator, that is, the emperours agent, treasurer, or receiuer, for in that citie (although it were inhabited by Romans) there was no great garrison of able men. Wherevpon the procurator sent them such aid as he thought he might well spare, which was not past two hundred men, and those not sufficientlie furnished either with weapon or armour.</p>
<p>The citie was not compassed with anie rampire or ditch for defense, such as happilie were priuie to the conspiracie, hauing put into the heads of the Romans that no fortification n*entity*eded: neither were the aged men nor women sent awaie, whereby the yoong able personages might without trouble of them the better attend to the defense of the citie: but euen as they had b*entity*ene in all suertie of peace, and fr*entity*e from suspicion of anie warre, they were suddenlie beset with the huge armie of the Britains, and so all went to spoile and fire that could be found without the inclosure of the temple, into the which the Romane souldiers (striken with sudden feare by this sudden comming of the enimies) had thronged themiselues. Where being assieged by the Britains, within the space of two daies the place was woonne, and they that were found within it, slaine euerie mothers sonne.</p>
<p>After this, the-Britains incouraged with this victorie, went to m*entity*et with Petus Cerealis lieutenant of the legion, surnamed the ninth, and boldlie incountering with the same legion, gaue the Romans the ouerthrow and slue all the footmen, so that Cerealis with much adoo escaped with his horssemen, and got him backe to the campe, and saued himselfe within the trenches. Catus the procurator being put in feare with this ouerthrow, and perceiuing what hatred the Britains bare towards him, hauing with his couetousnesse thus brought the warre vpon the head of the Romans, got him ouer into Gallia.</p>
<p>But Suetonius aduertised of these dooings, came backe out of Anglesey, and with maruellous constancie marched through the middest of his enimies to London, being as then not greatlie peopled with Romans, though there was a colonie of them, but full of merchants, and well prouided of vittels: he was in great doubt at his comming thither, whether he might best staie there as in a place most conuenient, or rather s*entity*eke some other more easie to be defended. At length considering the small number of his men of warre, and remembring how Cerealis had sped by his too much rashnesse, he thought better with the losing of one towne to saue the whole, than to put all in danger of irrecouerable losse. And therewith nothing mooued at the praier *entity* teares of them which besought him of aid and succour, he departed, and those that would go with him he receiued into his armie, those that taried behind were oppressed by the enimies: and the like destruction happened to them of Verolanium, a towne in those daies of great fame, situat n*entity*ere to the place where the towne of Saint Albons now standeth.</p>

 vsing their victorie with such crueltie, that they slue (as the report went) to the number of 70 thousand Ronmans, and such as tooke their part in the said places by the Britains thus woon and conquered. For there was nothing with the Britains but slaughter, fire, gallowes and such like, so earnestlie were they set on reuenge. They spared neither age nor sex: women of great nobilitie and woorthie fame they tooke and hanged vp naked, and cutting off their paps, sowed them to their mouthes, that they might s*entity*eme as if they sucked and fed on them, and some of their bodies they stretched out in length, and thrust them on sharpe stakes. All these things they did in great despite whilest they sacrificed in their temples, and made feasts, namelie in the wood consecrated to the honour of Andates, for so they called the goddesse of victoria whom they worshipped most reuerentlie.</p>

<p>IN this meane time there came ouer to the aid of Suetonius, the legion surnamed the 14, and other bands of souldiers and men of warre, to the number of ten thousand in the whole, wherevpon (chieflie bicause vittels began to faile him) he prepared to giue battell to his enimies, and chose out a plot of ground verie strong within straits, and backed with a wood, so that the enimies could not assault his campe but on the front: yet by reason of their great 

<note place="marg">The Britains were at that time 230000. men, (as <emph>Dion</emph> writeth.)</note>

 multitude and hope of victoria conceiued by their late prosperous successe, the Britains vnder the conduct of qu*entity*ene Voadicia aduentured to giue battell, hauing their women there to be witnesses of the victorie, whome they placed in charrets at the vttermost side of their field.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Corn. Tacit. li.</emph> 15. <emph>Dion Cassius.</emph></note>

<p>Voadicia, or Boudicia (for so we find hir written by some copies, and Bonuica also by Dion) hauing hir daughters afore hir, being mounted into a charret, as she passed by the souldiers of ech sundrie countrie, told them "it was a thing accustomed among the Britains to go to the warres vnder the leading of women; but she was not now come foorth as one borne of such noble ancestors as she was descended from, to fight for hir kingdome and riches; but as one of the meaner sort, rather to defend hir lost libertie, and to reuenge hir selfe of the enimie, for their crueltie shewed in scourging hir like a vagabond, and shamefull deflouring of hir daughters: for the licentious lust of the Romans was so farre spred and increased, that they spared neither the bodies of old nor yoong, but were readie most shamefullie to abuse them, hauing whipped hir naked being an aged woman, and forced hir daughters to satisfie their filthie concupiscence: but (saith she) the gods are at hand readie to take iust reuenge.</p>
<p>"The legion that presumed to incounter with vs is slaine and beaten downe. The residue keepe them close within their holds, or else s*entity*eke waies how to flee out of the countrie: they shall not be once able so much as to abide the noise and clamor of so manie thousands as we are h*entity*ere assembled, lesse the force of our great puissance and dreadfull hands. If ye therefore (said she) would wey and consider with your selues your huge numbers of men of warre and the causes why ye haue mooued this warre, ye would surelie determine <pb n="501"/>either in this battell to die with honour, or else to vanquish the enimie by plaine force, for so (quoth she) I being a woman am fullie resolued, as for you men ye maie (if ye list) liue and be brought into bondage."</p>
<p>"Neither did Suetonius ceasse to exhort his people: for though he trusted in their manhood, yet as he had diuided his armie into three battels, so did he make vnto ech of them a seuerall oration, willing them not to feare the shrill and vaine menacing threats of the Britains, sith there was among them more women than men, they hauing no skill in warrelike discipline, and heereto being naked without furniture of armour, would foorthwith giue place when they should f*entity*ele the sharpe points of the Romans weapons, and the force of them by whom they had so often b*entity*ene put to flight. In manie legions (saith he) the number is small of them that win the battell. Their glorie therefore should be the more, for that they being a small number should win the fame due to the whole armie, if they would (thronging togither) bestow their weapons fr*entity*elie, and with their swoords and targets preasse forward vpon their enimies, continuing the slaughter without regard to the spoile, they might assure themselues when the victorie was once atchiued to haue all at their pleasures."</p>
<p>Such forwardnesse in the souldiers followed vpon this exhortation of the couragious generall, that euerie one prepared himselfe so readilie to doo his dutie, and that with such a shew of skill and experience, that Suetonius hauing conceiued an assured hope of good lucke to follow, caused the trumpets to sound to the battell. The onset was giuen in the straits, greatlie to the aduantage of the Romans, being but a handfull in comparison to their enimies. The fight in the beginning was verie sharpe and cruell, but in the end the Britains being a let one to another (by reason of the narrownesse of the place) were not able to susteine the violent force of the Romans their enimies, so that they were constreind to giue backe, and so being disordered were put to flight, and vtterlie discomfited,</p>
<p>There were slaine of the Britains that day few lesse than 80000 thousand 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sic.</emph></note>

, as Tacitus 

<note place="marg">80000. Britains slaine.</note>

 writeth. For the straits being stopped with the charrets, staied the flight of the Britains, so as they could not easilie escape: and the Romans were so set on reuenge, that they spared neither man nor woman, so that manie were slaine in the battell, manie amongst the charrets, and a great number at the woods side, which way they made their flight, and manie were taken prisoners. Those that escaped, would haue fought a new battell, but in the meane time Voadicia, or Bonuica deceassed of a naturall infirmitie, as Dion Cassius writeth, but other say that she poisoned hir selfe, and so died, because she would not come into the hands of hir bloodthirstie enimies. There died of the Romans part in this most notable battell 400, and about the like number were grieuouslie hurt and most pitifullie wounded.</p>
<p>Penius Posthumous maister of the campe of the second legion, vnderstanding the prosperous 

<note place="marg">Penius Posthumus sleieth himselfe.</note>

 successe of the other Romane capteins, because he had defrauded his legion of the like glorie, and had refused to obeie the commandements of the generall, contrarie to the vse of warre, slue himselfe.</p>
<p>After this all the Romane armie was brought into the field to make an end of the residue of the warre. And the emperour caused a supplie to be sent out of Germanie being 2000 legionarie souldiers, and 8 bands of aids, with 1000 horssemen, by whose comming the bands of the ninth legion were supplied with legionarie souldiers, and those bands and wings of horssemen were appointed to places where they might winter, and such people of the Britains as were either enimies, or else stood in doubt whether to be friends or enimies in d*entity*ed, were persecuted with fire and sword.</p>
<p>But nothing more afflicted them than famine, for whilest euerie man gaue himselfe to the warre, and purposed to haue liued vpon the prouision of the Romans and other their enimies, they applied not themselues to tillage, nor to anie husbanding of the ground, and long it was yer they (being a fierce kind of people) fell to embrace peace, by reason that Iulius 

<note place="marg">Julius Cassicianus procurator.</note>

 Cassicianus, who was sent into Britaine as successor to Catus, fell at square with Suetonius, and by his priuat grudge hindered the prosperous successe of publike affaires. He sticked <pb n="502"/>not to write to Rome, that except an other were sent to succ*entity*ed in the roome that Suetonius did beare, there would be no end of the warres. Herevpon one Polycletus, which sometime had b*entity*ene a bondman, was sent into Britaine, as a commissioner to surueie the state of the countrie, to reconcile the legat and procurator, *entity* also to pacifie all troubles within the Ile.</p>
<p>The port which Polycletus bare was great, for he was furnished with no small traine that attended vpon him, so that his presence seemed verie dreadfull to the Romans. But the Britains that were not yet pacified, thought great scorne to see such honorable capteins and men of warre as the Romans were, to submit themselues to the order of such a one as had b*entity*ene a bondslaue.</p>

<p>AFTER the decease of Aruiragus, his sonne Marius succeeded him in the estate, and

 called Westmer, *entity* was a verie wise man, gouerning the Britains in great prosperitie, honour and wealth.</p>
<p>In the time of this mans reigne, the people called Picts inuaded this land, who are iudged 

<note place="marg"><date>73.</date></note>

 to be descended of the nation of the Scithians, neare kinsmen to the Goths, both by countrie 

<note place="marg">Of these you maie reade more in pag.</note>

 and maners, a cruell kind of men and much giuen to the warres. This people with their ringleader Roderike, or (as some name him) Londorike, entering the Ocean, sea after the maner 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 of rouers, arriued on the coasts of Ireland, where they required of the Scots new seats to inhabit in: for the Scots which (as some thinke) were also descended of the Scithians, did as then inhabit in Ireland: but doubting that it should not be for their profit to receiue so warlike a nation into that Ile, feining as it were a friendship, and excusing the matter by the narrownesse of the countrie, declared to the Picts, that the Ile of Britaine was not farre from thence, being a large countrie and a plentifull, and not greatly inhabited: wherefore they counselled them to go thither, promising vnto them all the aid that might be.</p>
<p>The Picts more desirous of spoile than of rule or gouernment without delaie returned to the sea, and sailed towards Britaine, where being arriued, they first inuaded the north parts thereof, and finding there but few inhabiters, they began to wast and forrey the countrie: whereof when king Marius was aduertised, with all speed he assembled his people, and made towards his enimies, and giuing them battell, obteined the victorie, so that Roderike was 

<note place="marg">Roderike king of Picts staine.</note>

 there slaine in the field, and his people vanquished.</p>
<p>Vnto those that escaped with life, Marius granted licence that they might inhabit in the north part of Scotland called Catnesse, being as then a countrie in maner desolate without habitation: wherevpon they withdrew thither, and setled themselues in those parties. And bicause the Britains disdained to grant vnto them their daughters in mariage, they sent vnto the Scots into Ireland, requiring to haue wiues of their nation. I he Scots agr*entity*ed to their request, with this condition, that where there wanted lawfull issue of the kings linage to succ*entity*ed in the kingdome of the Picts, then should they name one of the womans side to be their king: which ordinance was receiued and obserued euer after amongst the Picts, so long as their kingdome endured.</p>
<p>Thus the Picts next after the Romans were the first of anie strangers that came into this land to inhabit as most writers affirme, although the Scotish chronicles auouch the Picts to be inhabiters here before the incarnation of our sauiour, But the victorie which Marius obteined

 <pb n="504"/>against their king Roderike, chanced in the y*entity*ere after the incarnation 87. in remembrance of which victorie, Marius caused a stone to be erected in the same place where the battell was fought, in which stone was grauen these words, <emph>Marij victoria.</emph> The English chronicle saith that this stone was set vp on Stanesmoore, and that the whole countrie thereabout taking name of this Marius, was Westmaria, now called Westmerland.</p>
<p>King Marius hauing thus subdued his enimies, and escaped the danger of their dreadfull inuasion, gaue his mind to the good gouernement of his people, and the aduancement of the common wealth of the realme, continuing the residue of his life in great tranquillitie, and

<p>Humfrey Lhoyd s*entity*emeth to take this man and his father Aruiragus to be all one person, whether mooued thereto by some catalog of kings which he saw, or otherwise, I cannot affirme: but speaking of the time when the Picts and Scots should first come to settle themselues in this land, he hath these words; Neither was there anie writers of name, that made mention either of Scots or Picts before Vespasianus time, about the yeere of the incarnation 72: at what time Meurig or Maw, or Aruiragus reigned in Britaine, in which time our annales doo report, that a certeine kind of people liuing by pirasie and rouing on the sea, came foorth of Sueden, or Norwaie, vnder the guiding of one Rhithercus, who landed in Albania, wasting all the countrie with robbing and spoiling so farre as Caerleill, where he was vanquished in battell, and slaine by Muragus, with a great part of his people; the residue that escaped by flight, fled to their ships, and so conueied themselues into the Iles of Orkney and Scotland, where they abode quietlie a great while after.</p>
<p>Thus farre haue I thought good to shew of the foresaid Lhoyds booke, for that it seemeth to carie a great likelihood of truth with it, for the historie of the Picts, which vndoubtedlie I thinke were not as yet inhabiting in Britaine, but rather first placing themselues in the Iles of Orkney, made inuasion into the maine Ile of Britaine afterwards, as occasion was offred. In the British toong they are called Pightiaid, that is Pightians, and so likewise were they called in the Scotish, and in their owne toong. Now will we shew what chanced in this Ile, during the time of the foresaid Marius his supposed reigne, as is found in the Romane histories.</p>

<p>AFTER Iulius Frontinus, the emperor Vespasian sent Iulius Agricola to succ*entity*ed in the 

<note place="marg">Iulius Agricola lieutenant.</note>

 gouernement of Britaine, who comming ouer about the midst of summer, found the men of warre thorough want of a lieutenant negligent inough, those that looking for no trouble, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cor. Tacit. in vit. Agr.</emph> The first y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment.</note>

 thought themselues out of all danger, where the enimies neuerthelesse watched vpon the next occasion to worke some displeasure, and were readie on ech hand to mooue rebellion. For the people called Ordouices, that inhabited in the countrie of Chesshire, Lancashire and part of Shropshire, had latelie before ouerthrowne, and in maner vtterlie destroied a wing of such horssemen as soiourned in their parties, by reason whereof all the prouince was brought almost into an assured hope to recouer libertie.</p>
<p>Agricola vpon his comming ouer, though summer was now halfe past, and that the souldiers <pb n="505"/>lodging here *entity* there abroad in the countrie, were more disposed to take rest, than to set forward into the field against the enimies, determined yet to resist the present danger: and therewith assembling the men of warre of the Romans, and such other aids as he might make, he inuaded their countrie that had done this foresaid displeasure, and slue the most part of all the inhabitants thereof. Not thus contented (for that he thought good to follow the steps of fauourable fortune, and knowing that as the begining proued, so would the whole sequele of his affaires by likelihood come to passe) he purposed to make a full conquest of the Ile of Anglesey, from the conquest wherof the Romane lieutenant Paulinus was called 

<note place="marg">The Ile of Anglesey.</note>

 backe by the rebellion of other of the Britains, as before ye haue heard.</p>
<p>But whereas he wanted ships for the furnishing of his enterprise, his wit and policie found a shift to supplie that defect: for choosing out a piked number of such Britains as he had there with him in aid, which knew the foords and shallow places of the streames there, and withall were verie skilfull in swimming (as the maner of the countrie then was) he appointed them to passe ouer on the sudden into the Ile, onelie with their horsses, armor, and weapon: which enterprise they so sp*entity*edilie, and with so good successe atchiued, that the inhabitants much amazed with that dooing (which looked for a nauie of ships to haue transported ouer their enimies by sea, and therefore watched on the coast) began to thinke that nothing was able to be defended against such kind of warriors that got ouer into the Ile after such sort and maner.</p>
<p>And therefore making sute for peace, they deliuered the Ile into the hands of Agricola, 

<note place="marg">Anglesey y*entity*elded to Agricola.</note>

 whose fame by these victories dailie much increased, as of one that tooke pleasure in trauell, and attempting to atchiue dangerous enterprises, in stead whereof his predecessors had delighted, to shew the maiesties of their office by vaine brags, statelie ports, and ambitious pomps. For Agricola turned not the prosperous successe of his proc*entity*edings into vanitie, but rather with neglecting his fame, increased it to the vttermost, among them that iudged what hope was to be looked for of things by him to be atchiued, which with silence kept secret these his so woorthie dooings.</p>
<p>Moreouer, perceiuing the nature of the people in this Ile of Britaine, and sufficientlie taught by other mens example, that armor should little auaile where iniuries followed to the disquieting of the people, he thought best to take away and remooue all occasions of warre. 

<note place="marg">Agricola his good gouernment.</note>

 And first beginning with himselfe and his souldiers, tooke order for a reformation to be had in his owne houshold, y*entity*elding nothing to fauor, but altogither in respect of vertue, accounting them most faithfull which therein most excelled. He sought to know all things, but not to doo otherwise than reason mooued, pardoning small faults, and sharpelie punishing great and heinous offenses, neither yet deliting alwaies in punishment, but oftentimes in repentance of the offendor. Exactions and tributes he lessened, qualifieng the same by reasonable equitie. And thus in reforming the state of things, he wan him great praise in time of peace, the which either by negligence or sufferance of the former lieutenants. was euer feared, and accounted woorse than open warre. This was his practise in the winter time of his first yeere.</p>
<p>But when summer was come, he assembled his armie, and leading foorth the same, trained 

<note place="marg">His diligence.</note>

 his souldiers in all honest warlike discipline, commending the good, and reforming the bad and vnrulie. He himselfe to giue example, tooke vpon him all dangers that came to hand, and suffered not the enimies to liue in rest, but wasted their countries with sudden inuasions. And when he had sufficientlie chastised them, and put them in feare by such manner of dealing, he spared them, that they might againe conceiue some hope of peace. By which meanes manie countries which vnto those daies had kept themseluer out of bondage, laid rancor aside, and deliuered pledges, and further were contented to suffer castels to be builded within them, and to be kept with garrisons, so that no part of Britaine was fr*entity*e from the Romane power, but stood still in danger to be brought vnder more and more.</p>
<p>In the winter following, Agricola tooke paines to reduce the Britains from their rude 

<note place="marg">The second y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment.</note>

 manners and customs, vnto a more ciuill sort and trade of liuing, that changing their naturall <pb n="506"/>fiercenesse

 fiercenesse and apt disposition to warre, they might through tasting pleasures be so inured therewith, that they should desire to liue in rest and quietnesse: and therefore he exhorted them priuilie, and holpe them publikelie to build temples, common halls where pl*entity*es of law might be kept, and other houses, commending them that were diligent in such dooings and blaming them that were negligent, so that of necessitie they were driuen to striue who should preuent ech other in ciuilitie. He also procured that noble mens sonnes should learne the liberall sciences, and praised the nature of the Britains more than the people of Gallia bicause they studied to atteine to the knowledge of the Romane eloquence. By which meanes the Britains in short time were brought to the vse of good and commendable manners, and sorted themselues to go in comelie apparell after the Romane fashion, and by little and little fell to accustome themselues to fine fare and delicate pleasures, the readie prouokers of vices, as to walke in galleries, to wash themselues in bathes, to vse banketting, and such like, which amongst the vnskilfull was called humanitie or courtesie, but in verie deed it might be accounted a part of thraldome and seruitude, namelie being too excessiuelie vsed.</p>

<note place="marg">The third y*entity*ere.</note>

<p>In the third y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment in Britaine, he inuaded the north parts thereof (vnknowne till those daies of the Romans) being the same where the Scots now inhabit: 

<note place="marg">The water of Tay.</note>

 for he wasted the countrie vnto the water of Tay, in such wise putting the inhabitants in feare, that they durst not once set vpon his armie, though it were so that the same was verie sore disquieted and vexed by tempest and rage of weather. Wherevpon finding no great let or hinderance by the enimies, he builded certeine castels and fortresses, which he placed in such conuenient st*entity*eds, that they greatlie annoied his aduersaries, and were so able to be defended, that there was none of those castels which he builded, either woon by force out of the Romans hands, or giuen ouer by composition, for feare to be taken: so that the same beeing furnished with competent numbers of men of warre, were safelie kept from the enimies, the which were dailie vexed by the often issues made foorth by the souldiers that laie thus in garrison within them: so that where in times past the said enimies would recouer their losses susteined in summer by the winters aduantage, now they were put to the woorse, and kept backe as well in the winter as in the summer.</p>

<note place="marg">The fourth y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment. Clota. Bodotria.</note>

<p>In the fourth summer, after that Agricola was appointed vnto the rule of this land, he went about to bring vnder subiection those people, the which before time he had by incursions and forreies sore vexed and disquieted: and therevpoh comming to the waters of Clide and Loughleuen, he built certeine fortresses to defend the passages and entries there, driuing the enimies beyond the same waters, as it had beene into a new Iland.</p>

<note place="marg">The fift y*entity*ere.</note>

<p>In the fift summer, Agricola causing his ships to be brought about, and appointing them to arriue on the north coasts of Scotland, he passed with his armie ouer the riuer of Clide; and subdued such people as inhabited those further parts of Scotland, which till those daies had not beene discouered by the Romans. And bicause he thought it should serue well to purpose, for some conquest to be made of Ireland, if that part of Scotland which bordereth on the Irish seas might be kept in due obedience, he placed garrisons of souldiers in those parties, in hope verelie vpon occasion to passe ouer into Ireland, and for the more easie aduancement of his purpose therein, he interteined with honourable prouision one of the kings 

<note place="marg">An Irish king expelled out of his countrie.</note>

 of Ireland, which by ciuill discord was expelled and driuen out of his countrie. In d*entity*ed Agricola perceiued, that with one legion of souldiers, and a small aid of other men of warre it should be an easie matter to conquer Ireland, and to bring it vnder the dominion of the Romans: which enterprise he iudged verie necessarie to be exploited, for better k*entity*eping of the Britains in obedience, if they should s*entity*e the iurisdiction of the Romans euerie where extended, and the libertie of their neighbours suppressed.</p>

<note place="marg">The sixt y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment.</note>

<p>In the sixt summer of Agricola his gouernment, he proceeded in subduing the furthermost parts of Scotland northwards, causing his nauie to k*entity*epe course against him by the coast as he marched foorth by land, so that the Britains perceiuing how the secret hauens and cr*entity*ekes of their countries were now discouered, and that all hope of refuge was in maner cut off from them, were in maruellous feare. On the other part the Romans were sore troubled <pb n="507"/>with the rough mounteins and craggie rocks, by the which they were constreined to passe beside the dangerous riuers, lakes, woods, streicts, and other combersome waies and passages.</p>
<p>The danger also of them that were in the ships by sea was not small, by reason of winds and tempests, and high spring tides, which tossed and turmoiled their vessels verie cruellie: but by the painfull diligence of them that had b*entity*ene brought vp and inured with continuall trauell and hardnesse, all those discommodities were ouercome to their great reioising, when they met and fell in talke of their passed perils. For oftentimes the armie by land incamped so by the shore, that those which kept the sea came on land to make merrie in the camp*entity*, and then ech one would recount to others thie aduentures that had happened, as the manner is in semblable cases.</p>

<p>THE Britains that inhabited in those daies about the parts of Calenderwood, perceiuing 

<note place="marg">Calenderwood.</note>

 in what danger they were to be vtterlie subdued, assembled themselues togither, in purpose to trie the fortune of battell: whereof Agricola being aduertised, marched foorth with his armie diuided in three battels, so that the enimies doubting to trie the matter in open field, espied their time in the night, and with all their whole puissance set vpon one of the Romane legions, which they knew to be most f*entity*eble and weake, trusting by a camisado to distresse the same: and first sleaing the watch, they entred the campe, where the said legion laie, and finding the souldiers in great disorder, betwixt sl*entity*epe and feare, began the fight euen within the campe.</p>
<p>Agricola had knowledge of their purposed intent, and therefore with all speed hasted foorth to come to the succours of his people, sending first his light horssemen, and certeine light armed footmen to assaile the enimies on their backs, and shortlie after approched with his whole puissance, so that the Romane standards beginning to app*entity*ere in sight by the light of the daie that then began to spring, the Britains were sore discouraged, and the Romans renewing their force, fiercelie preassed vpon them, so that euen in the entrie of the campe, there was a sore conflict, till at length the Britains were put to flight and chased, so that if the mareshes and woods had not saued them from the pursute of the of te Romans, there had beene an end made of the whole warre euen by that one daies worke. But the Britains escaping as well as they might, and reputing the victorie to haue chanced not by the valiancie of the Romane soldiers, but by occasion, and the prudent policie of their capteine, were nothing abashed with that their present losse, but prepared to put their youth againe into armour: and therevpon they remooued their wiues and children into safe places, and then assembling the chiefest gouernours togither, concluded a league amongst themselues, ech to aid other, confirming their articles with dooing of sacrifice (as the manner in those daies was.)</p>

 Germanie *entity* sent ouer into Britaine to the aid of the Romans, attempted a great and woonderfull act, in sleaing their capteine, and such other of the Romane souldiers which were appointed to haue the training and leading of them, as officers and instructors to them in the feats of warre: and when they had committed that murther, they got into thr*entity*e pinesses, <pb n="508"/>and became rouers on the coasts of Britaine, and incountring with diuerse of the Britains that were readie to defend their countrie from spoile, oftentimes they got the vpper hand of them, and now and then they were chased awaie, insomuch that in the end they were brought to such extremitie for want of vittels, that they did eate such amongst them as were the weakest, and after, such as the lot touched, being indifferentlie cast amongst them: and so being caried about the coasts of Britaine, *entity* losing their vessels through want of skill to gouerne them, they were reputed for robbers, and therevpon were apprehended, first by the Suabeners, and shortlie after by the Frizers, the which sold diuerse of them to the Romans and other, whereby the true vnderstanding of their aduentures came certeinlie to light.</p>

<note place="marg">The eight y*entity*ere of Agricola his gouernment.</note>

<p>In summer next following, Agricola with his armie came to the mounteine of Granziben where he vnderstood that his enimies were incamped, to the number of 30 thousand and aboue, and dailie there came to them more companie of the British youth, and such aged persons also as were lustie and in strength, able to weld weapon and beare armour. 

<note place="marg">Galgagus whome the Scot. name Gald and will n*entity*eds haue him a Scotish man.</note>

 Amongst the capteins the chiefest was one Galgagus whom the Scotish chronicles name Gald. This man as chiefteine and head capteine of all the Britains there assembled, made to them a pithie oration, to incourage them to fight manfullie, and likewise did Agricola to him his people: which being ended, the armies on both sides were put in order of battell. Agricola placed 8 thousand footmen of strangers which he had there in aid with him in the midst, appointing thr*entity*e thousand horssemen to stand on the sides of them as wings. The Romane legions stood at their backs in st*entity*ed of a bulworke. The Britains were imbattelled in such order, that their fore ward stood in the plaine ground, and the other on the side of an hill, as though they had risen on heigth one ranke aboue another. The 

<note place="marg"><emph>Corn. Tacit.</emph></note>

 midst of the field was couered with their charrets and horssemen. Agricola doubting by the huge multitude of enimies, least his people should be assailed not onlie afront, but also vpon euerie side the battels, he caused the ranks so to place themselues, as their battels might stretch farre further in bredth than otherwise the order of warre required: but he tooke this to be a good remedie against such inconuenience as might haue followed, if the enimie by the narrownesse of the fronts of his battels should haue hemmed them in on ech side.</p>
<p>This done, and hauing conceiued good hope of victorie, he alighted on foot, and putting his horsse from him, he stood before the standards as one not caring for anie danger that might happen. At the first they bestowed their shot and darts fr*entity*elie on both sides. The Britains aswell with constant manhood, as skilfull practise, with broad swords and little round bucklers auoided and beat from them the arrowes and darts that came from their enimies, and therewithall paid them home againe with their shot and darts, so that the Romans were n*entity*ere hand oppressed therewith, bicause they came so thicke in their faces, 

<note place="marg">Betaui. Congri.</note>

 till at length Agricola caused thr*entity*e cohorts of Hollanders, *entity* two of Lukeners to presse forward, *entity* ioine with them at hand-strokes, so as the matter might come to be tried with the edge of the swoord, which thing as to them (being inured with that kind of fight) it stood greatlie with their aduantage, so to the Britains it was verie dangerous, that were to defend themselues with their mightie huge swoords and small bucklers. Also by reason their swoords were broad at the ends, and pointlesse, they auailed little to hurt the armed enimie. Wherevpon when the Hollanders came to ioine with them, they made fowle worke in sleaing and wounding them in most horrible wise.</p>
<p>The horssemen also that made resistance they pulled from their horsses, and began to clime the hill vpon the Britains. The other bands desirous to match their fellowes in helping 

<note place="marg">Hollanders.</note>

 to atchiue the victorie, followed the Hollanders, and beat downe the Britains where they might approch to them: manie were ouerrun and left halfe dead, and some not once touched with anie weapon, were likewise ouerpressed, such hast the Romans made to follow vpon the Britains. Whilest the British horssemen fled, their charets ioined themselues with their footmen, and restoring the battell, put the Romans in such feare, that they were <pb n="509"/>at a sudden stay: but the charets being troubled with prease of enimies, *entity* vn*entity*euennesse of the ground, they could not worke their feat to anie purpose, neither had that fight anie resemblance of a battell of horssemen, when ech one so encumbred other, that they had no roome to stirre themselues. The charets oftentimes wanting their guiders were caried awaie with the horsses, that being put in feare with the noise and stur, ran hither and thither, bearing downe one another, and whomsoeuer else they met withall.</p>
<p>Now the Britains that kept the top of the hils, and had not yet fought at all, despising the small number of the Romans, began to come downewards and to cast about, that they might set vpon the backs of their enimies, in hope so to make an end of the battell, and to win the victorie: but Agricola doubting no lesse, but that some such thing would come to passe, had aforehand fores*entity*ene the danger, and hauing reserued foure wings of horssemen for such sudden chances, sent them foorth against those Britains, the which horssemen with full randon charging vpon them as they rashlie came forwards, quicklie disordered them and put them all to flight, and so that purposed deuise and policie of the Britains turned to their owne hinderance. For their horssemen by their capteins appointment trauersing ouerthwart by the fronts of them that fought, set vpon that battell of the Britains which they found before them. Then in those open and plaine places a greeuous *entity* heauie sight it was to behold, how they pursued, wounded, and tooke. their enimies: and as they were aduised of other to slea those that they had before taken, to the end they might ouertake the other, there was nothing but fl*entity*eing, taking, and chasing, slaughter, spilling of bloud, scattering of weapons, grunting and groning of men and horsses that lay on the ground, gasping for breath, *entity* readie to die.</p>
<p>The Britains now and then as they saw their aduantage, namelie when they approched n*entity*ere to the woods, gathered themselues togither, and set vpon the Romans as they followed vnaduisedlie, and further (through ignorance of the places) than stood with their suertie, insomuch that if Agricola had not prouided remedie, and sent foorth mightie bands of light armed men both on foot and horssebacke to close in the enimies, and also to beat the wood, some greater losse would haue followed through too much boldnes of them that too rashlie pursued vpon the Britains: who when they beheld the Romans thus to follow them in whole troops and good order of battell, they slipt awaie and tooke the n to flight, ech one seeking to saue himselfe, and kept not togither in plumps as before they had doone, The night made an end of the chase which the Romans had followed till they were throughlie wearied. There were slaine of the Britains that day 10000, and of the Romans

<p>THE night insuing the foresaid ouerthrow of the Britains was spent of the Romans in great ioy *entity* gladnes for the victorie atchiued. But among the Britains there was nothing

 else heard but mourning and lamentation, both of men and women that were mingled togither, some busie to beare away the wounded, to bind and dresse their hurts; other calling for their sonnes, kinsfolkes and friends that were wanting. Manie of them forsooke their <pb n="510"/>houses, and in their desperate mood set them on fire, and choosing foorth places for their better refuge and safegard, foorthwith misliking of the same, left them and sought others: herewith diuerse of them tooke counsell togither what they were best to doo, one while they were in hope, an other while they fainted, as people cast into vtter despaire: the beholding of their wiues and children oftentimes mooued them to attempt some new enterprise for the preseruation of their countrie and liberties. And certeine it is that some of them slue their. wiues and children, as mooued thereto with a certeine fond regard of pitie to rid them out of further miserie and danger of thraldome.</p>
<p>The next day the certeintie of the victorie more plainlie was disclosed, for all was quiet about, and no noise heard anie where: the houses appeared burning on ech side, and such as were sent foorth to discouer the countrie into euerie part thereof, saw not a creature stirring, for all the people were auoided and withdrawne a farre off.</p>
<p>When Agricola had thus ouerthrowne his enimies in a pitcht field at the mountaine of Granziben, and that the countrie was quite rid of all appearance of enimies: bicause the summer of this eight y*entity*ere of his gouernement was now almost spent, he brought his armie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 into the confines of the Horrestians, which inhabited the countries now called Angus *entity* 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cor. Tacitus.</emph></note>

 Merne, and there intended to winter, and tooke hostages of the people for assurance of their

 loialtie and subiection. This doone, he appointed the admirall of the nauie to saile about the Ile, which accordinglie to his commission in that point receiued, luckilie accomplished his enterprise, and brought the nauie about againe into an hauen called Trutulensis.</p>
<p>In this meane time, whiles Iulius Agricola was thus occupied in Britaine, both the emperour Vespasianus, and also his brother Titus that succ*entity*eded him, departed this life, and Domitianus was elected emperor, who hearing of such prosperous successe as Agricola had against the Britains, did not so much reioise for the thing well doone, as he enuied to consider what glorie and renowme should redound to Agricola thereby, which he perceiued should much darken the glasse of his fame, hauing a priuate person vnder him, who in woorthinesse of noble exploits atchiued, farre excelled his dooings.</p>
<p>To find remedie therefore herein, he thought not good to vtter his malice as yet, whilest Agricola remained in Britaine with an armie, which so much fauoured him, and that with so good cause, sith by his policie and noble conduct the same had obteined so manie victories, so much honor, and such plentie of spoiles and booties. Wherevpon to dissemble his intent, he appointed to reuoke him footh of Britaine, as it were to honor him, not onelie with deserued triumphs, but also with the lieutenantship of Syria, which as then was 

<note place="marg">Cneus Trebellius alias Salustius Lucullus as some thinke.</note>

 void by the death of Aulius Rufus. Thus Agricola being countermanded home to Rome, deliuered his prouince vnto his successor Cneus Trebellius, appointed thereto by the emperour Domitianus, in good quiet and safegard.</p>
<p>*entity* Thus may you s*entity*e in what state Britaine stood in the daies of king Marius, of whome Tacitus maketh no mention at all. Some haue written, that the citie of Chester was builded by this Marius, though other (as before I haue said) thinke rather that it was the worke of

 the yeare of our Lord 125. This Coillus or Coill was brought vp in his youth amongst the

 Romans at Rome, where he spent his time not vnprofitablie, but applied himselfe to learning *entity* seruice in the warres, by reason whereof he was much honored of the Romans, and he likewise honored and loued them, so that he paied his tribute truelie all the time of his reigne, and therefore liued in peace and good quiet. He was also a prince of much bountie, and verie liberall, whereby he obteined great loue both of his nobles and commons. Some saie, that he made the towne of Colchester in Essex, but others write, that Coill which

 reigned next after Asclepiodotus was the first founder of that towne, but by other it should s*entity*eme to be built long before, being called Camelodunum.

<p><hi rend="smallcap">LUCIUS</hi> the sonne of Coillus, whose surname (as saith William Harison) is not extant, 

<note place="marg">LUCIUS.</note>

 began his reigne ouer the Britains about the yeare of our Lord 180, as Fabian following the authoritie of Peter Pictauiensis saith, although other writers seeme to disagr*entity*e in that account, as by the same Fabian in the table before his booke partlie appeareth, wherevnto Matthaeus Westmonasteriensis affirmeth, that this Lucius was borne in the yeare of our Lord 115, and was crowned king in the yeare 124, as successor to his father Coillus, which died the same yeare, being of great age yer the said Lucius was borne. It is noted by antiquaries, that his entrance was in the 4132 of the world, 916 after the building of Rome, 

<note place="marg">165.</note>

 220 after the comming of Caesar into Britaine, and 165 after Christ, whose accounts I follow in this treatise.</p>
<p>This Lucius is highlie renowmed of the writers, for that he was the first king of the Britains that receiued the faith of Iesus Christ: for being inspired by the spirit of grace and truth, euen from the beginning of his reigne, he somewhat leaned to the fauoring of Christian religion, being moued with the manifest miracles which the Christians dailie wrought in witnesse and proofe of their sound and perfect doctrine. For euen from the daies of Ioseph of Arimathia and his fellowes, or what other godlie men first taught the Britains the gospell of our Sauiour there remained amongest the same Britains some Christians which ceased not to teach and preach the word of God most sincerelie vnto them: but yet no king amongst them openlie professed that religion, till at length this Lucius perceiuing not onelie some of the Romane lieutenants in Britaine as Trebellius and Pertinax, with others, to haue submitted themselues to that profession, but also the emperour himselfe to begin to be fauorable to them that professed it, he tooke occasion by their good example to giue eare more attentiuelie vnto the gospell, and at length sent vnto Eleutherius bishop of Rome two learned men of the British nation, Eluane and Meduine, requiring him to send some such ministers as might instruct him and his people in the true faith more plentifullie, and to baptise them according to the rules of christian religion.</p>
<p>*entity* The reuerend father Iohn lewell, sometime bishop of Salisburie, writeth in his * replie 

<note place="marg">Fol. 119</note>

 vnto Hardings answer, that the said Eleutherius, for generall order to be taken in the realme <pb n="512"/>and churches h*entity*ere, wrote his aduice to Lucius in maner and forme following. "You haue receiued in the kingdome of Britaine, by Gods mercie, both the law and faih of Christ; ye haue both the new and the old testament, out of the same through Gods grace, by the aduise of your realme make a law, and by the same through Gods sufferance rule you your kingdome of Britaine, for in that kingdome you are Gods vicar."</p>
<p>Herevpon were sent from the said Eleutherius two godlie learned men, the one named Fugatius, and the other Damianus, the which baptised the king with all his familie and people, 

<note place="marg">Britaine receiueth the faith.</note>

 and therewith remoued the worshipping of idols and false gods, and taught the right meane and waie how to worship the true and immortal! God. There were in those daies within the bounds of Britaine 28 Flamines, *entity* thr*entity*e Archflamines, which were. as bishops and archbishops, or superintendents of the pagan or heathen religion, in whose place (they being remoued) were instituted 28 bishops *entity* thr*entity*e archbishops of the christian religion.

To the archbishop of Yorke all the north parts of Britaine from the riuer of Humber vnto the furthest partes of Scotland. And to the archbishop of Caerleon was subiect all Wales, within which countrie as then were seuen bishops, where now there are but foure. The riuer of Seuern in those daies diuided Wales (then called Cambria) from the other parts of Britaine. Thus Britaine 

<note place="marg">Iosephus of Arimathia.</note>

 partlie by the meanes of Ioseph of Arimathia (of whome ye haue heard before) *entity* partlie by the wholesome instructions *entity* doctrines of Fugatius and Damianus, was the first of all other regions that openlie receiued the gospell, and continued most stedfast in that profession, till the cruell furie of Dioclesian persecuted the same, in such sort, that as well in Britaine as in all other places of the world, the christian religion was in manner extinguished, and vtterlie destroied.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> Westminster Church built.</note>

<p>There be that affirme, how this Lucius should build the church of saint Peter at Westminster, though manie attribute that act vnto Sibert king of the east Saxons, and write how the place was then ouergrowne with thornes and bushes, and thereof tooke the name, and was called Thorney. They ad moreouer that Thomas archbishop of London preached, read, and ministred the sacraments there to such as made resort vnto him. Howbeit by the tables hanging in the reuestrie of saint Paules at London, and also a table sometime hanging in saint Peters church in Cornehill, it should s*entity*eme that the said church of saint Peter in Cornehill was the same that Lucius builded. But herein (saith Harison <emph>anno mundi</emph> 4174) dooth lie a scruple, Sure Cornell might soone be mistaken for Thorney, speciallie in such old records, as time, age, *entity* cuill handling haue oftentimes defaced.</p>
<p>But howsoeuer the case standeth, truth it is, that Lucius reioising much, in that he had brought his people to the perfect light and vnderstanding of the true God, that they n*entity*eded not to be deceiued anie longer with the craftie temptations and feigned miracles of wicked spirits, he abolished all prophane worshippings of false gods, and conuerted all such temples as had b*entity*ene dedicated to their seruice, vnto the vse of christian religion: and thus studieng onlie how to aduance the glorie of the immortall God, and the knowledge of his word, without seeking the vaine glorie of worldlie triumph, which is got with slaughter and bloudshed of manie a giltlesse person, he left his kingdome; though not inlarged with broder dominion than he receiued it, yet greatlie augmented and inriched with quiet rest, good ordinances, and (that which is more to be est*entity*emed than all the rest) adorned with Christes religion, and perfectlie instructed with his most holie word and doctrine. He 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor. Fabian. Iohn Hard.</emph></note>

 reigned (as some write) 21 yeares, though other affirme but twelue yeares. Againe, some testifie that he reigned 77, others 54, and 43.</p>
<p>Moreouer here is to be noted, that if he procured the faith of Christ to be planted within this realme in the time of Eleutherius the Romane bishop, the same chanced in the dales of the emperour Marcus Aurelius Antonius; and about the time that Lucius Aurelius Commodus was ioined and made partaker of the empire with his father, which was seuen y*entity*ere <pb n="513"/>after the death of Lucius Aelius, Aurelius Verus, and in the 177 after the birth of our Sauiour lesus Christ, as by some chronologies is easie to be collected. For Eleutherius began to gouerne the s*entity*e of Rome in the y*entity*ere 169, according to the opinion of the most diligent chronographers of our time, and gouerned fift*entity*ene yeeres and thirt*entity*ene daies. And yet there are that affirme, how Lucius died at Glocester in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 156. Other say that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. <unclear>Mo </unclear> Matth. West.</emph></note>

 he died in the yere 201, and other 208. So that the truth of this historie is brought into doubt by the discord of writers, concerning the time and other circumstances, although they all agr*entity*e that in this kings daies the christian faith was first by publike consent openlie receiued and professed in this land, which as some affirme, should chance in the twelfe y*entity*ere of his reigne, and in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 177. Other iudge that it came to passe in the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 eight yeere of his regiment, and in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 188, where other (as before is said) alledge that it was in the y*entity*ere of the Lord 179. Nauclerus saith, that this happened 

<note place="marg"><emph>Nauclervs.</emph></note>

 about the yeare of our Lord 156. And Henricus de Herfordea supposeth, that it was in the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Herf.</emph></note>

 y*entity*ere of our Lord 169, and in the nint*entity*enth y*entity*ere of the emperor Marcus Antonius Verus and after other, about the sixt y*entity*ere of the emperor Commodus.</p>
<p>But to conclude, king Lucius died without issue, by reason whereof after his deceasse the Britains fell at variance, which continued about the space of fift*entity*ene y*entity*eres (as Fabian thinketh) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 howbeit the old English chronicle affirmeth, that the contention betwixt them remained fiftie y*entity*eres, though Harding affirmeth but foure y*entity*eres. And thus much of the Britains, and

 their kings Coilus and Lucius. Now it resteth to speake somewhat of the Romans which gouerned here in the meane while. After that Agricola was called backe to Rome, the Britains (and namelie those that inhabited beyond Tweed) partlie being weakned of their former strength, and partlie in consideration of their pledges, which they had deliuered to the Romans, remained in peace certeine y*entity*eres.</p>

<p>With which newes Commodus being sore amazed, sent against the Britains one Vlpius Marcellus, a man of great diligence and temperance, but therewith rough and nothing gentle.

He was a capteine much watchfull, as one contented with verie little sl*entity*epe, and desirous to haue his souldiers also vigilant and carefull to k*entity*epe sure watch in the night season. Euerie euening he would write twelue tables, such as they vsed to make on the lind tr*entity*e, and deliuering them to one of his seruants, appointed him to beare them at seuerall houres of the night to sundrie souldiers, whereby supposing that their generall was still watching and not gone to bed, they might be in doubt to sl*entity*epe.</p>
<p>And although of nature he could we absteine from sl*entity*epe, yet to be the better able to forbeare it, he vsed a maruellous spare kind of diet: for to the end that he would not fill himselfe too much with bread, he would eat none but such as was brought to him from Rome, so that more than necessitie compelled him he could not eat, by reason that the stalenesse tooke awaie the pleasant tast thereof, and lesse prouoked his appetite. He was a maruellous contemner of monie, so that bribes might not mooue him to doo otherwise than dutie required.

Their answer was, that they were come to informe him of the treason which Perhennis had deuised to his destruction, that he might make his son emperor.

<p>NOW will we saie somewhat of the tumults in Britaine. It was thought n*entity*edfull to send

 some sufficient capteine of autoritie thither; and therefore was one Pertinax that had b*entity*ene consull and ruler ouer foure seuerall consular prouinces, appointed by Commodus to go as lieutenant into that Ile, both for that he was thought a man most m*entity*et for such a charge, and also to satisfie his credit, for that he had b*entity*ene discharged by Perhennis of bearing anie rule, and sent home into Liguria where he was borne, and there appointed to remaine.

<p><hi rend="smallcap">THEN</hi> was Clodius Albinus appointed to haue the rule of the Romane armie in Britaine:

The Romans would haue had Geta created king of Britaine, bearing more fauour to him because he had a Romane ladie to his mother: but the Britains moued with the like respect, held with Bassianus. And thervpon warre was raised betwixt the two brethren, who comming to trie their quarrell by battell, Geta was slaine, and Bassianus with aid of the Britains remained victor, and so continued king, till at length he was slaine by one Carausius a Britaine, borne but of low birth, howbeit right valiant in armes, and therefore well est*entity*emed.

H*entity*erevpon though he was of great age, yet the desire that he had still to win honour, caused him to take in hand to make a iournie into this land, and so being furnished of all things necessarie, he set forwards, being carried for the more part in a litter for his more ease: for that beside his f*entity*eblenesse of age, he was also troubled with the gout. He tooke with him his <pb n="517"/>two sonnes, Antoninus Bassianus and Geta, vpon purpose as was thought, to auoid occasions 

<note place="marg">Antoninus and Geta.</note>

 of such inconuenience as. he perceiued might grow by discord mooued betwixt them through flatterers and malicious sycophants, which sought to set them at variance: which to bring to passe, he perceiued there should want no meane whilest they continued in Rome, amidst such pleasures *entity* idle pastimes as were dailie there frequented: and therefore he caused them to attend him in this iournie into Britaine, that they might learne to liue soberlie, and after the manner of men of warre.</p>
<p>Seuerus being thus on his iournie towards Britaine, staied not by the waie, but with all

 diligence sped him foorth, and passing the sea verie swiftlie, entred this Ile, and assembled a mightie power togither, meaning to assaile his enimies, and to pursue the warre against them to the vttermost. The Britains greatlie amazed with this sudden arriuall of the emperour, and hearing that such preparation was made against them, sent ambassadours to him to intreat of peace, and to excuse their rebellious dooings. But Seuerus delaieng time for answere, as he that was desirous to atchiue some high enterprise against the Britains, for the which he might deserue the surname of Britannicus, which he greatlie coueted, still was busie to prepare all things necessarie for the warre; and namelie, caused a great number of bridges to be made to lay ouer the bogs and mareshes, so that his souldiers might haue place to stand vpon, and not to be incumbered for lacke of firme ground when they should cope with their enimies: for the more part of Britaine in those daies (as Herodianus writeth) was full

<p>Moreouer they marked, or (as it were) painted their bodies in diuerse sorts and with sundrie shapes and figures of beasts and fowles, and therefore they vsed not to weare anie garments, that such painting of their bodies might the more apparantlie be s*entity*ene, which they est*entity*emed a great brauerie.</p>

<p>Moreouer, to suffer hunger, cold, and trauell, they were so vsed and inured therewith, that they would not passe to lie in the bogs and mires couered vp to the chin, without caring for meate for the space of diuerse daies togither: and in the woods they would liue vpon roots and barks of tr*entity*es. Also they.vsed to prepare for themselues a certeine kind of meate, of the which if they receiued but so much as amounted to the quantitie of a beane, they would thinke themselues satisfied, and f*entity*ele neither hunger nor thirst. The one halfe of the Ile or little lesse was subiect vnto the Romans, the other was gouerned of themselues, the people for the most part hauing the rule in their hands.</p>
<p>Seuerus therefore meaning to subdue the whole, and vnderstanding their nature, and the manner of their making warre, prouided him selfe of all things expedient for the annoiance of them and helpe of his owne souldiers, and appointing his sonne Geta to remaine in that part of the Ile which was subiect to the Romans, he tooke with him his other sonne Antoninus, and with his armie marched foorth, and entred into the confines of the enimies, and there began to waste and forrey the countrie, whereby there insued diuerse conflicts and skirmishes betwixt the Romans and the inhabitants, the victorie still remaining on the Romans side: but the enimies easilie escaped without anie great losse vnto the woods, mountains, bogs, and such other places of refuge as they knew to be at hand, whither the Romans durst not follow, nor once approch, for feare to be intrapped and inclosed by the Britains that were <pb n="518"/>readie to returne and assaile their enimies vpon euerie occasion of aduantage that might be offered.</p>
<p>This maner of dealing sore troubled the Romans, and so hindered them in their proc*entity*edings, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Dion Cassius.</emph></note>

 that no sp*entity*edie end could be made of that warre. The Britains would oftentimes of purpose laie their cattell, as oxen, kine, sh*entity*epe, and such like, in places conuenient, to be as a stale to the Romans; and when the Romans should make to them to fetch the same awaie, being distant from the residue of the armie a good space, they would fall vpon them and distresse them. Beside this, the Romans were much annoied with the vnwholesomnesse of the waters which they were forced to drinke, and if they chanced to straie abroad, they were snapped vp by ambushes which the Caledonians laid for them, and when they were so f*entity*eble that they could not through want of strength k*entity*epe pace with their fellowes as they marched in order of battell, they were slaine by their owne fellowes, least they should be left behind for a prey to the enimies. H*entity*ereby there died in this iournie of the Romane armie, at the point of fiftie thousand men: but yet would not Seuerus returne, till he had gone through the whole Ile, and so came to the vttermost parts of all the countrie now called Scotland, and at last backe againe to the other part of the lie subiect to the Romans, the inhabitants whereof are named (by Dion Cassius) <emph>Meatae.</emph> But first he forced the other, whom the same Dion nameth Caledonij, to conclude a league with him, vpon such conditions, as they were compelled to depart with no small portion of the countrie, and to deliuer vnto him their armour and weapons.</p>
<p>In the meane time, the emperour Seuerus being worne with age fell sicke, so that he was constreined to abide at home within that part of the lie which obeied the Romans, and to appoint his sonne Antoninus to take charge of the armie abroad. But Antoninus not regarding the enimies, attempted little or nothing against them, but sought waies how to win the fauour of the souldiers and men of warre, that after his fathers death (for which he dailie looked) he might haue their aid and assistance to be admitted emperour in his place. Now when he saw that his father bare out his sicknesse longer time than he would haue wished, he practised with physicians and other of his fathers seruants to dispatch him by one meane or other.</p>
<p>Whilest Antoninus thus negligentlie looked to his charge, the Britains began a new rebellion, not onlie those that were latelie ioined in league with the emperour, but the other also which were subiects to the Romane empire. Seuerus tooke such displeasure, that he called togither the souldiers, and commanded them to inuade the countrie, and to kill all such as they might m*entity*et within anie place without respect, and that his cruell commandement he expressed in these verses taken out of Homer:

<p>But while he vas thus disquieted with the rebellion of the Britains, and the disloiall practises of his sonne Antoninus, which to him were not vnknowne, (for the wicked sonne had by diuers attempts discouered his traitorous and vnnaturall meanings) at length, rather

 otherwise called also Bassianus, would faine haue vsurped the whole gouernment into his owne hands, attempting with bribes and large promises to corrupt the minds of the souldiers: 

<note place="marg">211.</note>

 but when he perceiued that his purpose would not forward as he wished in that behalfe, he concluded a league with the enimies, and making peace with them, returned backe towards Yorke, and came to his mother and brother Geta, with whome he tooke order for the buriall of his father. And first his bodie being burnt (as the maner was) the ashes were put into a vessell of gold, and so conueied to Rome by the two brethren and the empresse Iulia, who was mother to Geta the yonger brother, and mother in law to the elder, Antoninus Bassianus, *entity* by all meanes possible sought to maintaine loue and concord betwixt the brethren, which now at the first tooke vpon them to rule the empire equallie togither. But the ambition of Bassianus was such, that finallie vpon desire to haue the whole rule himselfe, he found meanes to dispatch his brother Geta, breaking one daie into his chamber, and slaieng him euen in his mothers lap, and so possessed the gouernment alone, till at length he was slaine at Edessa a citie in Mesopotamia by one of his owne souldiers, as he was about to vntrusse his points to doo the office of nature, after he had reigned the space of 6 yeares, as is aforesaid.

But by the Scotish writers it should appeare, that those Picts which aided Fulgentius and also Carausius, were the same that long before had inhabited the north parts of Britaine, now called Scotland. But whatsoeuer they were, truth it is (as the British <pb n="520"/>histories record) that at length one Alectus was sent from Rome by the senat with 3 legions of souldiers to subdue Carausius, which he did, and slue him ia the field, as the same histories make mention, after he had reigned the space of 7, or 8, yeares: and in the yeare of our saluation two hundred, ninetie, three.</p>

Wherevpon the same Asclepiodotus assembling a great armie, made such sharpe warres on the Romans, that they being chased from place to place, at length withdrew to the citie of London, and there held them till Asclepiodotus came thither, and prouoked Alectus and his Romans so much, that in the end they issued foorth of the citie, and gaue battell to the Britans, in the which much people on both parts were slaine, but the greatest number died on the Romans side: and amongst others, Alectus himselfe was slaine, the residue of the Romans that were left aliue, retired backe into the citie with a capteine of theirs named Liuius Gallus, and defended themselues within the walles for a time right valiantlie. Thus

And verilie as there is but one name of Britaine, so was the losse to be esteemed smal to the common wealth of a land so plentifull of corne, so abundant with store of pastures, so flowing with veines of mettall, so gainfull with reuenues rising of customs and tributes, so enuironed with hauens, so huge in circuit, the which when Cesar, the founder of this your honourable title, being the first that entered into it, writ that he had found an other world, supposing it to be so big, that it was not compassed with the sea, but that rather by resemblance the great Ocean was compassed with it. Now at that time Britaine was nothing furnished with ships of warre; so that the Romans, soone after the warres of Carthage and Asia, had latelie beene exercised by sea against pirats, and afterwards by reason of the warres against Mithridates, were practised as well to fight by sea as land; besides this, the British nation then alone was accustomed but onelie to the Picts and Irishmen, enimies halfe naked as yet *entity* not vsed to weare armor, 

<note place="marg">Picts and Irishmen.</note>

 so that the Britains for lacke of skill, easilie gaue place to the Romane puissance, insomuch that Caesar might by that voiage onelie glorie in this, that he had sailed and passed ouer the Ocean sea.</p>

<pb n="522"/>
<p>"But in this wicked rebellious robberie, first the nauie that in times past defended the coasts of Gallia, was led away by the pirat when he fled his waies: and beside this, a great number of other ships were built after the mould of ours, the legion of Romane souldiers was woon, and brought to take part with the enimie, and diuers bands of strangers that were also souldiers were shut vp in the ships to serue also against vs. The merchants of the parties of Gallia were assembled and brought togither to the musters, and no small numbers of barbarous nations procured to come in aid of the rebels, trusting to inrich themselues by the spoile of the prouinces: and all these were trained in the wars by sea, through the instruction of the first attemptors of this mischieuous practise.</p>
<p>"And although our armies were inuincible in force and manhood, yet were they raw and not accustomed to the seas, so that the fame of a greeuous and great trouble by warre that was toward by this shamefull rebellious robberie was blowne and sounded in ech mans

 eare, although we hoped well of the end. Vnto the enimies forces was added a long sufferance of their wicked practises without punishment, which had puffed vp the presumptuous boldnesse of desperate people, that they bragged of our stay, as it had bene for feare of them, whereas the disaduantage which we had by sea, seemed as it were by a fatall necessitie to deferre our victorie: neither did they beleeue that the warre was put off for a time by aduise and counsell, but rather to be omitted through despaire of dooing anie good against them, insomuch that now the feare of common punishment being laid aside, one of 

<note place="marg">Carausius slaine.</note>

 the mates slue the archpirat or capteine rouer as I may call him, hoping in reward of so great an exploit, to obteine the whole gouernement into his hands.</p>
<p>"This warre then being both so necessarie, so hard to enter vpon, so growne in time to a stubborne stiffenesse, and so well prouided for of the enimies part, you noble emperour did so take it in hand, that so soone as you bent the thundering force of your imperiall maiestie against that enimie, ech man made account that the enterprise was alreadie atchiued. For first of all, to the end that your diuine power being absent, the barbarous nations should not attempt anie new trouble (a thing chieflie to be foreseene) it was prouided for aforehand by intercession made vnto your maiestie: for you your selfe, you (I say) mightie lord Maximian eternall emperour, vouchedsafe to aduance the comming of your diuine excellencie by the neerest way that might be, which to you was not vnknowne. You therefore suddenlie came to the Rhine, and not with anie armie of horssemen or footmen, but with the terrour of your presence did preserue and defend all that frontire: for Maximian once being there vpon the riuage, counteruailed anie the greatest armies that were to be found. For you (most inuincible emperour) furnishing and arming diuers nauies, made the enimie so vncerteine of his owne dooing and void of counsell, that then at length he might perceiue that he was not defended, but rather inclosed with the Ocean sea.</p>
<p>"Here commeth to mind how pleasant and easefull the good lucke of those princes in gouerning the common wealth with praise was, which sitting still in Rome had triumphs 

<note place="marg">Fronto counted Ciceros match.</note>

 and surnames appointed them of such nations as their capteins did vanquish. Fronto therefore, not the second, but match with the first honor of the Romane eloquence, when he yeelded vnto the emperor Antoninus the renowme of the warre brought to end in Britaine, although he sitting at home in his palace within the citie, had committed the conduct and successe of that warre ouer vnto the same Fronto, it was confessed by him, that the emperour sitting as it were at the helme of the ship, deserued the praise, by giuing of perfect order to the full accomplishing of the enterprise. But you (most inuincible emperour) haue bene not onlie the appointer foorth how all this voiage by sea, and prosecuting the warre by land should bee demeaned, as apperteined to you by vertue of your imperiall rule and dignitie, but also you haue beene an exhorter and setter forward in the things themselues, and through example of your assured constancie, the victorie was atchiued. For you taking the sea at Sluice, did put an irreuocable desire into their hearts that were readie to take ship at the same time in the mouth of the riuer of Saine, insomuch that when the capteins of that armie did linger out the time, by reason the seas and aire was troubled, they <pb n="523"/>cried to haue the sailes hoised vp, and signe giuen to lanch foorth, that they might passe forward on their iournie, despising certeine tokens which threatened their wrecke, and so set forward on a rainie and tempestuous day, sailing with a crosse wind, for no forewind might serue their turne.</p>
<p>"But what was he that durst not commit himselfe vnto the sea, were the same neuer so vnquiet, when you were once vnder saile, and set forward? One voice and exhortation was among them all (as report hath gone thereof) when they heard that you were once got forth vpon the water, What doo we dout? what mean we to staie? He is now loosed from land, he is forward on his waie, and peraduenture is alreadie got ouer: Let vs put all things in proofe, let vs venter through anie dangers of sea whatsoeuer. What is there that we may stand in feare of? we follow the emperour. Neither did the opinion of your good hap deceiue them: for as by report of them selues we doo vnderstand, at that selfe time there fell such a mist and thicke fog vpon the seas, that the enimies nauie laid at the Ile of wight watching for their aduersaries, and lurking as it were in await, these your ships passed by, and were not once perceiued, neither did the enimie then staie although he could not resist.</p>
<p>"But now as concerning that the same vnuanquishable army fighting vnder your ensignes and name, streightwaies after it came to land, set fire on their ships; what mooued them so to doo, except the admonitions of your diuine motion? Or what other reason persuaded them to reserue no furtherance for their flight, if need were, nor to feare the doubtfull chances of war, nor (as the prouerbe saith) to thinke the hazard of martiall dealings to be common, but that by contemplation of your prosperous hap, it was verie certeine that there needed no doubt to be cast for victorie to be obteined? There were no sufficient forces at that present among them, no mightie or puissant strength of the Romans, but they had onelie consideration of your vnspeakable fortunate successe comming from the heauens aboue. For whatsoeuer battell dooth chance to be offered, to make full account of victorie, resteth not so much in the assurance of the souldiers, as in the good lucke 

<note place="marg">The good lucke in a capteine.</note>

 and felicite of the capteine generall.</p>
<p>"That same ringleader of the vngratious faction, what ment he to depart from that shore which he possessed? Why did he forsake both his nauie and the hauen? But that (most inuincible emperour) he stood in feare of your comming, whose sailes he beheld readie to approch towards him, how soeuer the matter should fall out, he chose rather to trie his fortune with your capteins, than to abide the present force of your highnes. Ah mad man! that vnderstood not, that whither so euer he fled, the power of your diuine maiestie to be present in all places where your countenance *entity* banners are had in reuerence. But he fleeing from your presence, fell into the hands of your people, of you was he ouercome, of your armies was he oppressed.</p>
<p>"To be short, he was brought into such feare, and as it were still looking behind him, for doubt of your comming after him, that as one out of his wits and amazed, he wist not what to doo, he hasted forward to his death, so that he neither set his men in order of battell, nor marshalled such power as he had about him, but onlie with the old authors of that conspiracie, and the hired bands of the barbarous nations, as one forgetfull of so great preparation which he had made, ran headlong forwards to his destruction, insomuch (noble emperour) your felicitie yeeldeth this good hap to the common wealth, that the victorie being atchiued in the behalfe of the Romane empire, there almost died not one Romane: for as I heare, all those fields and hills lay couered with none but onelie with the bodies of most wicked enimies, the same being of the barbarous nations, or at the least-wise apparelled in the counterfet shapes of barbarous garments, glistering with their long yellow haires, but now with gashes of wounds and bloud all deformed, and lieng in sundrie manners, as the pangs of death occasioned by their wounds had caused them to stretch foorth or draw in their maimed lims and mangled parts of their dieng bodies. And among these, the

<p>"Thus verelie (most inuincible emperour) so great a victorie was appointed to you by consent of the immortall gods ouer all the enimies whome you assailed, but nameie the slaughter of the Frankeners and those your souldiers also, which (as before I haue said)

But now being thus slaine by your souldiers, the subiects of your prouince were both preserued from further danger, and tooke pleasure to behold the slaughter of such cruell enimies. O what a manifold victorie was this, worthie vndoubtedlie of innumerable triumphes! by which victorie Britaine is restored to the empire, by which victorie the nation of the Frankeners is vtterlie destroied, *entity* by which manie other nations found accessaries in the conspiracie of that wicked practise, are compelled to obedience. To conclude, the seas are purged and brought to perpetuall quietnesse.</p>
<p>"Glorie you therefore, inuincible emperour, for that you haue as it were got an other world, *entity* in restoring to the Romane puissance the glory of conquest by sea, haue added to the Romane empire an element greater than all the compasse of the earth, that is, the mightie maine ocean. You haue made an end of the warre (inuincible emperour) that seemed as present to threaten all prouinces, and might haue spred abroad and burst out in a flame, euen so largelie as the ocean seas stretch, and the mediterrane gulfs doo reach. Neither are we ignorant, although through feare of you that infection did fester within the bowels of Britaine onelie, and proceeded no further, with what furie it would haue aduanced it selfe else where, if it might haue beene assured of means to haue ranged abroad so far as it wished.

And so therefore by this your victories not Britaine alone is deliuered from bondage, but vnto all nations is safetie restored, which might by the vse of the seas come to as great perils in time of warre, as to gaine of commodities in time of peace.</p>
<p>"Now Spaine (to let passe the coasts of Gallia) with hir shores almost in sight is in suertie: now Italie, now Afrike, now all nations euen vnto the fens of Meotis are void of perpetuall cares.

<p>"Neither was it anie maruell if they shewed them selues so ioifull, sith after their miserable captiuitie so manie yeeres continued, after so long abusing of their wiues, and filthie bondage of their children, at length yet were they now restored to libertie, at length made Romans, at length refreshed with the true light of the imperiall rule and gouernement: for beside the fame of your clemencie and pitie, which was set forth by the report of all nations, in your countenance (Caesar) they perceiued the tokens of all vertues, in your face grauitie, in your eies mildnesse, in your ruddie cheekes bashfulnesse, in your words iustice: all which things as by regard they acknowledged, so with voices of gladnesse they signified on high.

<head type="title"> What is to be obserued and noted out of the panegyrike oration of Mamertinus afore remembred, with necessarie collections out of other Antiquaries.</head>
<head type="unitnum">The Xxv. Chapter.</head>

<p>NOW let vs consider what is to be noted out of this part of the foresaid oration. It should seeme that when the emperour Maximian was sent into Gallia by appointment taken betwixt him and Dioclesian, after he had quieted things there, he set his mind foorth-with to reduce Britaine vnder the obedience of the empire, which was at that present kept vnder subiection of such princes as mainteined their state, by the mightie forces of such number of ships as they had got togither, furnished with all things necessarie, *entity* namelie of 

<note place="marg">Franci, or Frankeners, people of Germanie.</note>

 able seamen, as well Britains as strangers, among whome the Frankeners were chiefe, a nation of Germanie, as then highly renowmed for their puissance by sea, neere to the which they inhabited, so that there were no rouers comparable to them.</p>
<p>But because none durst stirre on these our seas for feare of the British fl*entity*et that passed to and fro at pleasure, to the great annoiance of the Romane subiects inhabiting alongst the coasts of Gallia, Maximian both to recouer againe so wealthie and profitable a land vnto the obeisance of the empire, as Britaine then was, and also to deliuer the people of Gallia subiect to the Romans, from danger of being dailie spoiled by those rouers that were mainteined here in Britaine, he prouided with all diligence such numbers of ships as were thought requisite for so great an enterprise, and rigging them in sundrie places, tooke order for their setting forward to his most aduantage for the easie atchiuing of his enterprise. He appointed to passe himselfe from the coasts of Flanders, at what time other of capteines with their fleets from other parts should likewise make saite towards Britaine. By this meanes Alectus that had vsurped the title *entity* dignitie of king or rather emperour ouer the Britains, knew not where to take heed, but yet vnderstanding of the nauie that was made readie in the mouth of Saine, he ment by that which maie be coniectured, to intercept that fl*entity*et, as it should come foorth and make saile forwards: and so for that purpose he laie with a great number of ships about the Ile of Wight.</p>
<p>But whether Asclepiodotus came ouer with that nauie which was rigged on the coasts of Flanders, or with some other, I will not presume to affirme either to or fro, because in d*entity*ed Mamertinus maketh no expresse mention either of Alectus or Asclepiodotus: but notwithstanding it is euident by that which is conteined in his oration, that not Maximian, but some other of his capteins gouerned the armie, which slue Alectus, so that we maie suppose that Asclepiodotus was chiefteine ouer some number of ships directed by Maximians appointment to passe ouer into this lie against the same Alectus: and so maie this, which Mamertinus 

<note place="marg"><emph>Eutropius.</emph></note>

 writeth, agr*entity*e with the truth of that which we doo find in Eutropius.</p>
<p>H*entity*ere is to be remembred, that after Maximians had thus recouered Britaine out of their hands that vsurped the rule thereof from the Romans, it should s*entity*eme that not onelie great numbers of artificers *entity* other people were conueied ouer into Gallia, there to inhabit and furnish such cities as were run into decaie, but also a power of warlike youths was transported thither to defend the countrie from the inuasion of barbarous nations. For we find that in the daies of this Maximian, the Britains expelling the Neruians out of the citie of Mons in Henaud, held a castell there, which was called Bretaimons after them, wherevpon the citie was afterward called Mons, reteining the last syllable onlie, as in such cases it hath often happened.</p>
<p>Moreouer this is not to be forgotten, that as Humfrey Lhoyd hath very well noted in his booke intituled "Fragmenta historiae Britannicae," Mamertinus in this parcell of his panegyrike oration dooth make first mention of the nation of Picts, of all other the ancient Romane writers: so that not one before his time once nameth Picts or Scots.

<head type="unitnum">The Xxvj. Chapter.</head>
<p>AFTER that Britaine was thus recduered by the Romans, Dioclesian and Maximian ruling the empire, the Iland tasted of the crueltie that Dioclesian exercised against the christians, in persecuting them with all extremities, continuallie for the space of ten y*entity*eres. Amongst other, one Alban a citizen of Werlamchester, a towne now bearing his name, was the first that suffered here in Britaine in this persecution, being conuerted to the faith by the zealous christian Amphibalus, whom he receiued into his house: insomuch that when there 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda and Gyldas.</emph></note>

 came sergeants to s*entity*eke for the same Amphibalus, the foresaid Alban to preserue Amphibalus out of danger, presented himselfe in the apparell of the said Amphibalus, *entity* so being apprehended in his stead, was brought before the iudge and examined: and for that he refused to doo sacrifice to the false gods, he was beheaded on the top of an hill ouer against the towne of Werlamchester aforesaid where afterwards was builded a church and monasterie in remembrance of his martyrdome, insomuch that the towne there restored, after that Werlamchester was destroied, tooke name of him, and so is vnto this day called saint Albons.</p>
<p>It is reported by writers, that diuers miracles were wrought at the time of his death, insomuch that one which was appointed to doo the execution, was conuerted, and refusing to

There were also martyred about the same time two constant witnesses of Christ his religion, Aaron and Iulius, citizens of Caerleon

<p>To be briefe, this persecution was so great and greeuous, and thereto so vniuersall, that in maner the Christian religion was thereby destroied. The faithfull people were slaine,

<p>*entity* But by the way touching this Coelus, I will not denie, but assuredly such a prince there was: howbeit that he had a daughter named Helen, whom he maried vnto Constantius the Romane lieutenant that was after emperor, I leaue that to be decided of the learned.

<note place="marg">CONSTANTIUS. <emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith 302.</note>

<p>CONSTANTIUS a senatour of Rome began to reigne ouer the Britains, in the yeere of our Lord 289, as our histories report. This Constantius (as before ye haue heard) had to wife Helen the daughter of the foresaid king Coel, of whome he begat a sonne named 

<note place="marg"><date>289.</date></note>

 Constantinus, which after was emperour, and for his woorthie dooings surnamed Constantine 

<note place="marg"><emph>Orosius. Beda.</emph></note>

 the great. S. Ambrose following the common report writeth that this Helen was a maid in an inne: and some againe write, that she was concubine to Constantius, and not his wife. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cuspinian.</emph></note>

 But whatsoeuer she was, it appeareth by the writers of the Romane histories, that Constantius 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 being the daughters sonne of one Crispus, that was brother to the emperour Claudius, came into Britaine, and quieted the troubles that were raised by the Britains, d there (as some write) maried the foresaid Helen, being a woman of an excellent beauties whom yet [after] he was constreined to forsake, and to marrie Theodora the daughter in law of Herculeus Maximianus, by whome he had six sonnes, and finallie was created emperour, togither with the said Galerius Maximianus, at what time Dioclesianus and his fellow Herculeus Maximianus renounced the rule of the empire, and committed the same vnto them. The empire was then diuided betwixt them, so that to Constantius the regions of Italie, Affrike, France, Spaine and, Britaine were assigned; *entity* to Galerius, Illyricum, Grecia, and all the east parts. But Constantine being a man void of ambition, was contented to leaue Italie and Affrike, supposing his charge to be great inough to haue the gouernement in his hands of France, Spaine, and Britaine (as Eutropius saith.)</p>
<p>But as touching his reigne ouer the Britains, we haue not to say further than as we find in our owne writers recorded: as for his gouernement in the empire, it is to be considered, that first he was admitted to rule as an assistant to Maximian vnder the title of Cesar: and so from that time if you shall account his reigne, it maie comprehend 11, 12, or 13 yeeres, yea more or lesse, according to the diuersitie found in writers, Howbeit, if we shall reckon his reigne from the time onelie that Dioclesian and Maximian resigned their title vnto the empire, we shall find that he reigned not fullie thr*entity*e y*entity*eres. For whereas betw*entity*ene the slaughter of Alectus, and the comming of Constantius, are accounted 8 y*entity*eres and od moneths, not onelie those eight y*entity*eres, but also some space of time before maie be ascribed vnto Constantius: for although before his comming ouer into Britaine now this last time (for he had b*entity*ene here afore, as it well app*entity*ereth) Asclepiodotus gouerning as legat, albeit vnder Constantius, who had a great portion of the west parts of the empire vnder his regiment, by the title, as I haue said, of Caesar, yet he was not said to reigne absolutelie, till Dioclesian and Maximian resigned. But now to conclude with the dooings of Constantius, 

<note place="marg"><date>306.</date></note>

 at length he fell sicke at Yorke, and there died, about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 306.</p>

<pb n="529"/>
<p>This is not to be forgotten, that whilest he laie on his death-bed, somewhat before he departed this life, hearing that his sonne Constantine was come, and escaped from the emperours Dioclesian and Maximian, with whom he remained as a pledge (as after shall be partlie touched) he recciued him with all ioy, and raising himselfe vp in his bed, in presence of his other sonnes *entity* counsellours, with a great number of other people and strangers that were come to visit him, he set the crowne vpon his sonnes head, and adorned him with other imperiall robes and garments, executing as it were him selfe the office of an herald, and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Niceph.</emph></note>

 withall spake these woords vnto his said sonne, and to his counsellours there about him: "Now is my death to me more welcome, and my departure hence more pleasant; I haue 

<note place="marg"><emph>Tripartit. histo.</emph></note>

 h*entity*ere a large epitaph and monument of buriall, to wit, mine owne sonne, and one whome in earth I leaue to be emperour in my place, which by Gods good helpe shall wipe away the teares of the Christians, and reuenge the crueltie exercised by tyrants. This I reckon to chance vnto me in st*entity*ed of most felicitie."</p>
<p>After this, turning himselfe to the multitude, he commanded them all to be of good comfort, meaning those that had not forsaken true vertue aid godlinesse in Christ, which Christ he vndertooke should continue with his sonne Constantine in all enterprises, which in warres or otherwise he should take in hand. That dcuise also is woorthie to be had in memorie, which he put in practise in his life time, to vnderstand what true and sincere Christians were remaining in his court. For whereas he had b*entity*ene first a persecuter, and after was conuerted, it was a matter easie to persuade the world, that he was no earnest Christian: and so the policie which he thought to worke, was the sooner brought to passe, which was this.</p>
<p>He called togither all his officers and seruants, feining himselfe to choose out such as would doo sacrifice to diuels, and that those onelie should remaine with him and k*entity*epe their office, and the rest that refused so to doo, should be thrust out, and banished the court. H*entity*ervpon all the courtiers diuided themselues into companies: and when some offered willinglie to doo sacrifice, and other some boldlie refused: the emperour marking their dealings, sharpelie rebuked those which were so readie to dishonour the liuing God, accounting them as treitours to his diuine maiestie, and not woorthie to remaine within the court gates: but those that constantlie stood in the profession of the christian faith, he greatlie commended, as men woorthie to be about a prince: and withall declared, that from thencefoorth they should be as chiefe counsellours and defenders both of his person and kingdome, est*entity*eming more of them than of all the treasure he had in his coffers.</p>
<p>To conclude, he was a graue prince, sober, vpright, courteous and liberall, as he which kept his mind euer fr*entity*e from couetous desire of great riches: insomuch that when he should make anie great feast to his friends, he was not ashamed to borow plate and siluer vessell to serue his turne, and to furnish his cupbord for the time, being contented for himselfe to be 

<note place="marg"><emph>Pomponius Laenis.</emph></note>

 serued in cruses *entity* earthen vessels. He was woont to haue this saieng in his mouth, that better it was that the subiects should haue store of monie and riches, than the prince to k*entity*epe it close in his treasurie, where it serued to no vse. By such courteous dealing the prouinces which were in his charge flourished in great wealth and quietnesse. He was a verie wise and politike prince in the ordering of all weightie matters, and verie skillfull in the practise 

<note place="marg">He died in the y*entity*ere 306. as <emph>Matt. West.</emph> hath noted, and reigned ouer the Britains but 11. y*entity*eres as <emph>Galf.</emph> saith.</note>

 of warres, so that he stood the Romane empire in great st*entity*ed, and was therefore highlie beloued of the souldiers, insomuch that immediatlie after his deceasse, they proclaimed his sonne Constantine emperour.</p>
<p>That the christian faith was imbraced of the Britains in this season, it maie app*entity*ere, in that Hilarius bishop of Poictiers writeth to his brethren in Britaine, and Constantine in an epistle (as Theodoretus saith in his first booke and tenth chapter) maketh mention of the churches in Britaine: which also Sozomenus dooth affirme.

<p>This Maxentius was sonne to Herculeus Maximianus, and Constantine had married Fausta the daughter of the said Maximianus. Now so it was, that Maximianus, immediatlie after that his sonne Maxentius had taken the rule vpon him, sought meanes to haue deposed him, and to haue resumed and taken eftsoones, into his owne hands the gouernment of the empire. But soliciting Dioclesian to doo the like, he was much reprooued of him for his vnreasonable and ambitious purpose: so that when he perceiued that neither Dioclesian would be thereto agreeable, nor induce the souldiers to admit him, they hauing alreadie established his sonne, began to deuise waies how to assure the state more stronglie to his said sonne. And hearing that his sonne in law Constantine was minded, to come into Italie against him, he purposed to practise Constantines destruction, insomuch that it was iudged by this which followed, that 

<note place="marg">Dissimulation.</note>

 Herculeus Maximianus did but for a colour s*entity*enme to mislike that which his said son Maxentius <pb n="531"/>had doone, to the end he might the sooner accomplish his intent for the dispatching of Constantine out of the waie.</p>
<p>Heerevpon (as it were) fl*entity*eing out of Italie, he came to Constantine, who as then hauing 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ranulphus Cestrensis.</emph></note>

 appointed lieutenants vnder him in Britaine, remained in France, and with all ioy and honour that might be, receiued his father in law: the which being earnestlie bent to compasse his purpose, made his daughter Fausta priuie thereto: which ladie (either for feare least the concealing 

<note place="marg">Fausta the daughter of Maximianus and wife to Constantine. Marsiles.</note>

 thereof might turne hir to displeasure, either else for the entire loue which she bare to hir husband) reuealed hir fathers wicked purpose. Wherevpon whilest Constantine went about to be reuenged of such a traitorous practise, Herculeus fled to Marsiles, purposing there to take the sea, and so to retire to his sonne Maxentius into Italie. But yer he could get awaie from thence, he was strangled by commandement of his sonne in law Constantine, and 

<note place="marg">Maximianus slaine. <emph>Ann. Chri.</emph> 322.</note>

 so ended his life, which he had spotted with manie cruell acts, as well in persecuting the professours of the christian name, as others.</p>
<p>In this meane time had Maximianus adopted one Licinius to assist him in gouernance of the 

<note place="marg">Licinius chosen fellow with Maximianus in the empire.</note>

 empire, proclaiming him Caesar. So that now at one selfe time Constantine gouerned France and the west parts of the empire, Maxentius held Italie, AfFrike, and Aegypt: and Maximianus which likewise had beene elected Caesar, ruled the east parts, and Licinius Illyriunm and Grecia. But shortlie after, the emperour Constantine ioined in league with Licinius, and gaue to him his sister in marriage, named Constantia, for more suertie of faithfull friendship to indure betwixt them. He sent him also against Maximianus who gouerning in the east part of the empire, purposed the destruction of Constantine and all his partakers: but being vanquished by Licinius at Tarsus, he shortlie after died, being eaten with lice. Constantine after this was called into Italic, to deliuer the Romans and Italians from the tyrannie of Maxentius, which occasion so offered, Constantine gladlie accepting, passed into Italie, and after.certeine victories got against Maxentius, at length slue him.</p>
<p>After this, when Maximianus was dead, who prepared to make warre against Licinius, that had married Constantia the sister of Constantine, he finallie made warre against his brother in law the said Licinius, by reason of such quarrels as fell out betwixt them. In the which warre Licinius was put to the woorse, and at length comming into the hands of Constantine, was put to death, so that Constantine by this meanes got the whole empire vnder his rule and subiection. He was a great fauourer of the Christian religion, insomuch that to aduance the same, he tooke order for the conuerting of the temples dedicated to the honour of idols, vnto the seruice of the true and almightie God. He commanded also, that none should be admitted to serue as a souldier in the warres, except he were a christian, nor yet 

<note place="marg">Christians honoured and cherished.</note>

 to haue rule of anie countrie or armie. He also ordeined, the w*entity*eke before Easter, and that which followed to be kept as holie, and no person to doo anie bodilie woorks during the same.</p>
<p>He was much counselled by that noble and most vertuous ladie his mother, the empresse 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> The praise of the empresse Helen.</note>

 Helen, who being a godlie and deuout woman, did what in hir laie, to mooue him to the setting foorth of Gods honour and increase of the Christian faith, wherein as yet he was not fullie instructed. *entity* Some writers alledge, that she being at Ierusalem, made diligent search 

<note place="marg"><date>328.</date></note>

 to find out the place of the sepulchre of our Lord, and at length found it, though with much adoo: for the infidels had stopped it vp, and couered it with a heape of filthie earth, and builded aloft vpon the place, a chappell dedicated to Venus, where yoong women vsed to sing songs in honour of that vnchast goddesse. Helen caused the same to be ouerthrowne, the earth to be remooued, and the place cleansed, so that at length the sepulchre app*entity*ered, and fast by were found there buried in the earth thr*entity*e crosses and the nailes. But the crosse wherevpon our Sauiour was crucified, was knowne by the title written vpon it, though almost worne out, in letters of Hebrew, Gr*entity*eke, and Latine: the inscription was this, <emph>Iesus Nazarenus rex Indaeorum.</emph> It was also perceiued which was that crosse by a miracle (as it is reported, but how trulie I can not tell) that should be wrought thereby: for being laid to a sicke woman, onlie with the touching thereof she was healed. It was also said, that a dead <pb n="532"/>man was raised from death to life, his bodie onlie being touched therewith. Wherevpon Constantine mooued with these things, forbad that from thencefoorth anie should be put to death on the crosse, to the end that the thing which afore time was accounted infamous and reprochfull, might now be had in honour and reuerence.</p>
<p>The empresse Helen hauing thus found the crosse, builded a temple there, *entity* taking with hir the nailes, returned with the same to hir sonne Constantine, who set one of them in the crest of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 his helmet, an other in the bridle of his horsse, and the third he cast into the sea, to asswage and pacifie the furious tempests and rage thereof. She also brought with hir a parcell of that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 holie crosse, and gaue it to hir sonne the said Constantine, the which he caused to be closed within an image that represented his person, standing vpon a piller in the market place of Constantine, or (as some late writers haue) he caused it to be inclosed in a coffer of gold, adorned with rich stones and pearls, placing it in a church called Sessoriana, the which church he indued with manie great gifts and precious ornaments. Manie works of great zeale and vertue are remembered by writers to haue b*entity*ene doone by this Constantine and his mother Helen, to the setting foorth of Gods glorie, and the aduancing of the faith of Christ. 

<note place="marg">The commendation of Constantine.</note>

 But to be briefe, he was a man in whome manie excellent vertues and good qualities both of mind and bodie manifestlie app*entity*ered, chiefle he was a prince of great knowledge and experience in warre, and therewith verie fortunate, an earnest louer of iustice, and to, conclude, borne to all honour.</p>
<p>But now to speake somewhat of the state of Britaine in his time, ye shall vnderstand, that as before is recorded, at his going ouer into France, after that he was proclaimed emperour, he left behind him in Britaine certeine gouernours to rule the land, and amongst other one Maximinus a right valiant capteine. He tooke with him a great part of the youth of Britaine, and diuerse of the chiefe men amongst the nobilitie, in whose approoued manhood, loialtie, and constancie, he conceiued a great hope to go thorough with all his enterprises, as with the which being accompanied and compassed about, he passed ouer into Gallia, entred into Italie, and in euerie place ouercame his enimies.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Culielmus Malmes.</emph> Britains seruing in the warres vnder Constantine.</note>

<p>Some write that Constantine thus conueieng ouer sea with him a great armie of Brntains, and by their industrie obteining victorie as he wished, he placed a great number of such as were discharged out of wages, and licenced to giue ouer the warre, in a part of Gallia towards the west sea coast, where their postenrtie remaine vnto, this daie, maruellouslie increased afterwards, and somewhat differing from our Britains, the Welshmen, in manners and language.

Before his landing he was aduertised that an earle of Britaine which bare him heartie good will, had by treason slaine Traherne. Octauius then comming to land, eftsoones

 got possession of Britaine, which should be (as Fabian gathereth) about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 329, in the 20 y*entity*ere of the reigne of the emperour Constantine, and about two y*entity*eres after that the said Octauius first tooke vpon him to rule as king.</p>
<p>After this (as the British chronicle affirmeth) Octauius gouerned the land right noblie, and greatlie to the contentation of the Britains. At length when he was fallen in age, and had no issue but one daughter, he was counselled to send vnto Rome for one Maximianus, a

 noble yoong man, coosine to the emperour Constantine, on the part of his mother Helena, to come into Britaine, and to take to his wife the said daughter of Octauius, and so with hir to haue the kingdome. Octauius at the first meant to haue giuen hir in mariage vnto one Conan Meridoc duke of Cornewall, which was his nephue: but when the lords would not thereto agr*entity*e, at the length he appointed one Maurice sonne to the said Conan to go to Rome to fetch the forenamed Maximianus.</p>
<p>Maurice according to his commission and instruction in that behalfe receiued, came to Rome, and declared his message in such effectuall sort, that Maximianius consented to go 

<note place="marg">Maximianus commeth into Britaine.</note>

 with him into Britaine, and so taking with him a conuenient number, set forward, and did so much by his iournies, that finallie he landed here in Britaine. And notwithstanding that Conan Meridoc past not so much to haue b*entity*ene dooing with him, for malice that he conceiued towards him, because he saw that by his meanes he should be put beside the crowne, yet at length was Maximianus safelie brought to the kings presence, and of him honorablie receiued, and finallie the mariage was knit vp, and solemnized in all princelie maner. Shortlie after, Octauius departed our. of this life, after he had reigned the terme of fiftie and 

<note place="marg">Octauius departeth this life.</note>

 foure yeares, as Fabian gathereth by that which diuers authors doo write, how he reigned till the daies that Gratian and Valentinian ruled the Roman empire which began to gouerne in the yeare of our Lord (as he saith) 382, which is to be vnderstood of Gratian his reigne 

<note place="marg"><date>382.</date></note>

 after the deceasse of his vncle Valens, for otherwise a doubt maie rise, because Valentine the father of Gratian admitted the said Gratian to the title of Augustus in the yeare of our Lord 351.</p>
<p>But to leaue the credit of the long reigne of Octauius, with all his and others gouernement and rule ouer the Britains since the time of Constantius, vnto our.British and Scotish writers, let vs make an end with the gouernement of that noble emperour Constantine, and assured branch of the Britains race, as borne of that worthie ladie the empresse Helen, daughter to <pb n="534"/>Coell earle of Colchester, and after king of Britaine (as our histories doo witnesse.) Vnto the which empresse Constantine bare such dutifull reuerence, that he did not onelie honour hir with the name of empresse, but also made hir as it were partaker with him of all his wealth, and in manie things was led and ruled by hir vertuous and godlie admonitions, to the aduancement of Gods honour, and maintenance of those that professed the true christian religion. For the loue that she bare vnto Colchester and London, she walled them about and caused great bricke and huge tiles to be made for the performance of the same, whereof there is great store to be s*entity*ene euen yet to this present, both in the walls of the towne and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Nicephorus.</emph> The empresse Helen departeth this life.</note>

 castell of Colchester, as a testimonie of the woorkemanship of those daies. She liued 79 yeares, and then departed this life about the 21 yeare of hir sonnes reigne. First she was buried at Rome without the walls of the citie with all funerall pompe, as to hir estate apperteined:

 but after hir corps was remoued and brought to Constantinople, where it was eftsoones interred. Hir sonne the emperour Constantine liued till about the yeare of Christ 

<note place="marg">The deceasse of the empetour Constantine.</note>

 340, and then deceassed at Nicomedia in Asia, after he had ruled the empire 32 yeares and od moneths,.</p>
<p>We find not in the Romane writers of anie great stur here in Britaine during his reigne more than the British and Scotish writers haue recorded: so that after Traherne had reduced this land to quietnesse, it maie be supposed, that the Britains liued in rest vnder his gouernement, and likewise after vnder his sonnes that succeeded him in the empire, till about the 

<note place="marg"><date>360.</date></note>

 yeare 360, at what time the Picts and Scots inuaded the south parts of the land.</p>
<p>But now to end with Octauius, that the christian faith remained still in Britaine, during the supposed time of this pretended kings reigne, it maie appeare, in that amongst the 36 prouinces, out of the which there were assembled aboue 300 bishops in the citie of Sardica 

<note place="marg"><emph>Synodus Anno.</emph> 351.</note>

 in Dacia, at a synod held there against the Eusebians, Britaine is numbred by Athanasius in his second apologie to be one. And againe, the said Athanasius in an epistle which he writeth to the emperour Iouinianus reciteth, that the churches in Britaine did consent with the churches of other nations in the confession of faith articuled in the Nicene councell. Also mention is made by writers of certeine godlie *entity* learned men, which Hued in offices in the church in those daies, as Restitutus bishop of London, which went ouer to the synod held at Arles in France, and also one Kibius Corinnius sonne to Salomon duke of Cornewall, and bishop of Anglesey, who instructed the people that inhabited the parts now called Northwales, and them of Anglesey aforesaid verie diligentlie.</p>
<p>But now to speake somewhat of things chancing in Britaine about this season (as we find recorded by the Romane writers) some trouble was likelie to haue growne vnto the Britains by receiuing certeine men of warre that fled out of Italie into Britaine, whome the emperour 

<note place="marg"><emph>Marcellinus. lib.</emph> 14. Paulus a notarie.</note>

 Constantius would haue punished, because they had taken part with Maxentius his aduersarie. Paulus a Spaniard and notarie was sent ouer by him, with commission to make inquirie of them, and to s*entity*e them brought to light to answere their transgressions: which Paulus began to deale roughlie in the matter, whereof he was called Catera, and to rage against the Britains and partakers with the fugidues, in that they had receiued and mainteined them, as 

<note place="marg">Martinus lieutenant.</note>

 he alledged: but in the end being certified by Martinus the lieutenant of their innocencie, and fearing least his extreame rigour might alienate the hearts of the inhabitants altogither, and cause them to withdraw their obedience from the Romane empire, he turned the execution of his furie from them vnto the Romans, and, made hauocke of those that he suspected, till the said Martinus fell at square with him, *entity* thinking on a time to kill him, he drew his sword and smote at him. But such was his age and weakenesse, that he was not able to kill him or giue him anie deadlie wound: wherefore he turned the point of his sword against himselfe, and so ended his life, being contented rather to die than s*entity*e his countriemen and subiects of the empire so to be abused. After this the said Paulus returned backe againe into Italie from whence he came, after whose departure, it was not long yer he also was slaine, and then all the Scots and Picts sore disquieted the Romane subiects, for the suppressing of whose attempts Lupicinus was sent ouer out of Gallia by Iulianus, as shall be declared out of <pb n="535"/>Amianus Marcellinus, after we haue first shewed what we find written in our owne writers concerning the Scots and Picts, who now began to rob and spoile the British inhabitants within the Romane prouinces here in this Ile, and that euen in most outragious maner.</p>

<p>AFTER the deceasse of Octauius or Octauian (as the old English chronicle nameth him) 

<note place="marg">MAXIMIANUS OR MAXIMUS.</note>

 Maximianus or Maximus (as the Romane writers call him) began to rule the Britains in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 383, he was the sonne of one Leonine, and coosen germane to Constantine 

<note place="marg"><date>383.</date></note>

 the great, a valiant personage, *entity* hardie of stomach: but yet because he was cruell of nature, and (as Fabian saith) somewhat persecuted the chritians, he was infamed by writers: but the chiefe cause why he was euil reported, was for that he slue his souereigne lord the emperour Gratianus, as after shall appeare, for otherwise he is supposed woorthie to haue had the rule of the empire committed to his hands in ech respect. Betwixt him and the abouenamed Conan Meridoc duke of Cornewall, chanced strife and debate, so that Conan got him into Scotland, and there purchasing aid, returned, and comming ouer Humber, wasted the countrie on ech side. Maximianus thereof hauing aduertisement, raised his power and went against him, and so fighting with him diuers battels, sometime departed awaie with victorie, and sometime with losse. At length through mediation of friends, a peace was made betwixt them. Finallie this Maximianus, or (as the Romane histories say) Maxmus, was by the souldiers chosen and proclaimed emperour here in Britaine: although some write that this was doone in Spaine.</p>
<p>After he had taken vpon, him the imperiall dignitie, vpon desire to hue inlarged his dominion, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon. Fabian. Caxton. Matth. West.</emph> The British youth led forth of the realme by Maximianus. Britaine in France.</note>

 he assembled togither all the hosen youth of this land m*entity*et to doo seruice in the warres, with the which he passed ouer into France *entity* there (as our writers record) he first subdued the countrie ancientlie called Armorica, and slue in battell the king thereof called Imball. This doone he gaue the countries vnto Conan Meridoc, which was there with him, to hold the same of him, and of the kings of great Britaine for euer. He also commanded that the said countrie from thencefoorth should be called litle Britaine, and so was the name changed. What people soeuer inhabited there before, the ancient name argueth that they were rather Britains than anie other: for Armorica in the British toong signifieth as much as a countrie lieng vpon the sea.</p>
<p>Conan then placing himselfe and his Britains in that quarter of Gallia, auoided all the old inhabitants, peopling that countrie onelie with Britains, which abhorring to. ioine themselues with women borne in Gallia, Conan was counselled to send into Britaine for maids to be coupled with his people in manage. Herevpon a messenger was dispatched vnto Dionethus 

<note place="marg">Dionetliusduke of Cornwall. Maids sent foorth.</note>

 at that time duke of Cornwall, and gouernour of Britaine vnder Maximianus, requiring him to send ouer into little Britaine 11000 maids, that is to say, 8000 to be bestowed vpon the meaner sort of Conans. people, and 3000 to be ioined in mariage with the nobles and gentlemen. Dionethus at Conans request, assembled the appointed number of maids, and amongst them he also appointed his daughter Vrsula, a ladie of excellent beautie, to go ouer and to be giuen in mariage to the foresaid Conan. Meridoc, as he had earnestlie requested.</p>

<pb n="536"/>

<note place="marg">Vrsula the daughter of Dionethus.</note>

<p>These number of maids were shipped in Thames, and passing forward toward Britaine were by force of weather and rage of wind scattered abroad, and part of them drowned, and the residue (among whom was the foresaid Vrsula) were slaine by Guanius king of the Hunnes and Melga king of the Picts, into whose hands they fell, the which Guamnuis and Melga were sent by the emperour Gracian to the sea coasts of Germanie, to oppresse and subdue all such as were friends and mainteiners of the part of Maximianus. We find in some bookes, that there were sent ouer at that time 5100 maids, that is to say, 11000 gentlewomen, and 40000 other.</p>

<note place="marg">Guanius and Melga.</note>

<p>After that Guanius and Melga had murthered the foresaid virgins, they entred into the north parts of Britaine, where the Scots now inhabit, and began to make sore warre on the Britains, whereof when Maximus was aduertised, he sent into Britaine one Gratianus with thr*entity*e legions of souldiers, who bare himselfe so manfullie against the enimies, that he constreined the said Guanius and Melga to flie out of the land, and to withdraw into Ireland. In this meane while, Maximus hauing slaine the emperor Gratian at Lions in France, and after entring into Italie, was slaine himselfe at Aquilia (after he had gouerned the Britains eight y*entity*eres) by the emperour Theodosius, who came in aid of Valentinian, brother to the said emperor Gratian, as ye may find in the abridgement of the histories of Italie.</p>
<p>*entity* But here vet before we make an end with this Maximus or Maximianus, I haue thought good to set downe the words which we find in Gyldas, where he writeth of the same Maximus 

<note place="marg">Consobrinus Helenae imperatricis.</note>

 vndoubtedlie a Britaine borne, nephue to the empresse Helen, and begotten by a Romane. "At length (saith Gyldas) the spring of tyrants budding vp, and now increasing into an huge wood, the Ile being called after the name of Rome, but holding neither maners nor lawes according to that name, but rather casting the same from it, sendeth foorth a branch of hir most bitter planting, to wit Maximus, accompanied with a great number of warriors to gard him, and apparelled in the imperiall robes which he neuer ware as became him, nor put them on in lawfull wise, but (after the custome of tyrants) was put into them by the mutining souldiers: which Maximus at the first by craftie policie rather than by true manhood winding in (as nets of his periurie and false suggestion) vnto his wicked gouernement the countries *entity* prouinces next adioining, against the imperiall state of Rome, stretching one of his wings into Spaine, and the other into Italie, placed the throne of his most vniust empire at Trier, and shewed such rage in his wood dealing against his souereigne lords, that the one of the lawfull emperours he expelled out of Rome, and the other he bereft of his most religious and godlie life. Now without long tariance, compassed about with such a furious and bold gard as he had got togither, at the citie of Aquilia he loseth his wicked head, which had cast downe the most honourable heads of all the world from their kingdomne and empire.</p>
<p>"From thencefoorth Britaine being depriued of all hir warlike souldiers and armies, of hir gouernors also (though cruell) and of an huge number of hir youth (the which following the steps of the foresaid tyrant, neuer returned home againe) such as remained being vtterlie vnskilfull in feats of warre, were troden downe by two nations of beyond the seas, the Scots

<p>BUT now where the British histories, and such of our English writers as follow them, make mention of one Gratianus a Romane, sent ouer with thr*entity*e legions of souldiers by Maximus, as before ye haue heard: we maie suppose that it was Gratianus the Britaine, that afterwards vsurped the imperiall dignitie h*entity*ere in Britaine, in the dales of the emperour Honorius. For it standeth neither with the concurrence of time nor yet with reason of the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sextus Aurelius</emph></note>

 historie, that it should be Gratianus, surnamed Funarius, father to Valentinian, and grandfather to the emperour Gratianus, against whome Maximus rebelled. And yet I remember not that anie of the Romane writers maketh mention of anie other Gradtanus, being a stranger, that should be sent hither as lieutenant to gouerne the Romane armie, except of the foresaid Gratianus Funarius, who (as app*entity*ereth by Amian. Marcellinus) was generall of the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Lib.</emph> 30.</note>

 Romane armie h*entity*ere in this Ile, and at length being discharged, returned home into Hungarie (where he was borne) with honour, and there remaining in rest, was at length spoiled of his goods by the emperour Constantius as confiscate, for that in time of the ciuill warres he had receiued Maxentius, as he past thorough his countrie.</p>
<p>But let vs grant, that either Gratianus the Britaine, or some other of that name, was sent ouer into Britaine (as before is said) by Maximus, least otherwise some errour may be doubted in the writers of the British histories, as hauing happilie mistaken the time and matter, bringing Gratianus Funarius to serue vnder Maximus, where peraduenture that which they haue read or heard of him, chanced long before that time by them suppposed: and so thorough mistaking the thing, haue made a wrong report, where neuerthelesse it standeth with great likelihood of truth, that some notable seruice of chiualrie was atchiued by the same Gratianus Funarius whilest he remained h*entity*ere in this Ile, if the truth might be knowne of that which hath b*entity*ene written by authors, and happilie by the same Am. Marcellinus, if his first thirt*entity*ene bookes might once come to light and be extant.</p>
<p>But now to end with Maximus. William of Malmesburie (as ye haue heard) writeth, that not Maximus, but rather Constantine the great first peopled Armorica: but yet he agr*entity*eth, that both Maximus, and also Constantinus the vsurper, of whome after ye shall heare, led with them a great number of the Britains out of this land, the which Maximus or Maximianus and Constantinus afterwards being slaine, the one by Theodosius, and the other by Honorius, the Britains that followed them to the warres, part of them were killed, and the residue escaping by flight, withdrew vnto the other Britains which Constantine the great had first placed in Armorica. And so when the tyrants had left none in the countrie but rude people, nor anie in the townes but such as were giuen to slouth and gluttonie, Britaine being void of all aid of hir valiant youth, became a prey to hir next neighbours the Scots and Picts.</p>
<p>H*entity*ere is yet to be considered, in what price the souldiers of the British nation were had in these daies, with whose onelie puissance Maximus durst take vpon him to go against all other the forces of the whole Romane empire: and how he prospered in that dangerous aduenture, it is expressed sufficientlie in the Romane histories, by whose report it app*entity*ereth, that <pb n="538"/>

<note place="marg"><emph>W. H.</emph> out of <emph>Paulus Diaco. lib.</emph> 12. <emph>*entity* alijs.</emph></note>

 he did not onlie conquer all the hither parts of France and Germanie, namelie on this side the Rhine, but also found meanes to intrap the emperour Gratian by this kind of policie, He had a faithfull friend called Andragatius, who was admirall of the seas perteining to the empire. It was therefore agr*entity*ed betwixt them, that this Andragatius (with a chosen companie of the armie) should be carried in secret wise in a coch toward Lions, as if it had b*entity*ene 

<note place="marg"><emph>Tripart. hist. lib.</emph> 9. <emph>cap.</emph> 21.</note>

 Constantia Posthumia the empresse, wife to the emperour Gratian, bruting abroad there withall, that the said empresse was comming forwards on hir waie to Lions, there to m*entity*et with hir husband, for that vpon occasion she was verie desirous to commune with him about certeine earnest businesse.</p>
<p>When Gratian heard h*entity*ereof, as one mistrusting no such dissimulation, he made hast to meete his wife, and comming at length without anie great gard about him, as one not in doubt of anie treason, approched the coch, where supposing to find his wife, he found those that streightwaies murthered him: *entity* so was he there dispatched quite of life by the said Andragatius, who leapt foorth of the coch to woorke that feate when he had him once within his danger.</p>
<p>Thus did the emperour Gratian finish his life in the 29 y*entity*ere of his age, on the 25 of 

<note place="marg"><date>383.</date></note>

 August, in the y*entity*ere of Christ 383, and then died. Maximus succ*entity*eded him (making his sonne Flauius Victor Nobilissimus his assistant in the empire) reigning fiue y*entity*eres and two 

<note place="marg">This Flauius Victor he begat of his wife Helen the daughter of Eudes. <emph>H. Lhoyd.</emph></note>

 daies. In the beginning of his reigne Valentinian the yoonger made great suit to him to haue his fathers bodie, but it would not be granted. Afterwards also Maximus was earnestlie requested to come to an enteruiew with the same Valentinian, who promised him not onelie a safe conduct, but also manie other beneficiall good turnes beside. Howbeit Maximus durst not put himselfe in anie such hazard, but rather ment to pursue Valentinian as an vsurper, and so at length chased him into Slauonie, where he was driuen to such a streight, that if 

<note place="marg">Valentinianput in danger by Maximus.</note>

 Theodosius had not come to releeue him, Maximus had driuen him thence also, or else by slaughter rid him out of the waie.</p>
<p>But when Maximus thought himselfe most assured, and so established in the empire, as he doubted no perils, he liued carelesse of his owne safegard, and therfore dismissed his British souldiers, who retiring into the northwest parts of Gallia, placed themselues there among their countriemen, which were brought ouer by the emperour Constantius, whilest Maximus 

<note place="marg"><emph>Eutropius.</emph></note>

 passing the residue of his time in delights and pleasures, was surprised in the end and slaine 

<note place="marg">388.</note>

 by Theodosius n*entity*ere vnto Aquila, the 27 of August, in the y*entity*ere of Grace 388, and in the beginning of the sixt y*entity*ere of his reigne, or rather vsurpation, as more rightlie it maie be tearmed. His sonne Flauius Victor surnamed Nobilissimus was also dispatched and brought to his end, not farre from the place where his father was slaine, by the practise of one Arbogastes 

<note place="marg">Arbogastes.</note>

 bogastes a Goth, which Flauius Victor was by the said Maximus made regent of the Frankeners, and partaker (as before is said) with him in the empire.</p>
<p>After this, the Ile of Britaine remained in meetlie good quiet by the space of twentie y*entity*eres, till one Marcus (that was then legat, or as we maie call him lord lieutenant or deputie of Britaine for the Romans) was by the souldiers h*entity*ere proclaimed emperour against Honornus, which Marcus was soone after killed in a tumult raised among the people within few daies 

<note place="marg">Gratianus a Britaine. He reigned foure y*entity*eres if we shal bel*entity*eue the British historie.</note>

 after his vsurpation began. Then one Gratianus a Britaine borne succ*entity*eded in his place, who was also slaine in the fourth moneth, after he had taken vpon him the imperiall ornaments. The souldiers not yet heerewith pacified, proc*entity*eded to the election of an other emperour, or rather vsurper, and so pronounced a noble gentleman called Constantine, borne also in Britaine, to be emperour, who tooke that honour vpon him in the 409 y*entity*ere after the 

<note place="marg"><date>409.</date></note>

 birth of our Sauiour, continuing his reigne by the space of two yeeres and od moneths, as the Romane histories make mention. Some report this Constantine to be of no great towardlie disposition woorthie to gouerne an empire, and that the souldiers chose him rather for the name sake, bicause they would haue another Constantine, more than for anie vertues or sufficient qualities found in his person. But other commend him both for manhood and wisedome, wherein to speake a truth, he deserued singular commendation, if this one note <pb n="539"/>of vsurpation of the imperiall dignitie had not stained his other noble qualities. But heerein he did no more than manie other would haue doone, neither yet after his inuesture did so much as was looked for at his hands.</p>
<p>Constantine being placed in the imperiall throne, gathered an armie with all possible indeuour, purposing out of hand to go ouer therwith into France, and so did, thinking thereby to win the possession of that countrie out of the hands of Honorius, or at the least to worke so, as he should not haue the souldiers and people there to be against him, if he missed to ioine in league with the Suabeiners, Alanes, and Vandales, which he sought to performe. But in the end, when neither of these his deuises could take place, he sent ouer for his sonne Constans (whome in his absence his aduersaries had shorne a moonke) *entity* making him partaker with him in the empire, caused him to bring ouer with him another armie, which vnder the conduct of the same Constans he sent into Spaine to bring that countrie vnder his obeisance.</p>
<p>This Constans therefore comming vnder the passages that lead ouer the Pyrenine mountains, Dindimus and Verianianus two brethren, vnto whome the keeping of those passages was committed to defend the same against the Vandals, and all other enimies of the empire, 

<note place="marg">His souldiers were Picts, and placed among other men of warre that serued vnder the ensignes of the empire, and named after Honorius, Honoriciani. <emph>Blondus.</emph></note>

 were readie to resist him with their seruants and countriemen that inhabited therabouts, giuing him a verie sharpe incounter, and at the first putting him in great danger of an ouerthrow, but yet at length by the valiant prowes of his British souldiers, Constans put his aduersaries to flight, and killed the two capteins, with diuers other men of name, that were partakers with him in the necessarie defense of that countrie against the enimies. When Constans had thus repelled those that resisted him, the custodie of the passages in the Pyrenine mounteins was committed vnto such bands of Picts and other, as were appointed to go with him about the atchiuing of this enterprise, who hauing the possession of those streicts or passages in their hands, gaue entrie vnto other barbarous nations to inuade Spaine, who being once entered, pursued the former inhabitants with fire and swoord, setled them selues in that countries and droue out the Romans.</p>

<head type="title"> Honorius sendeth earle Constantius to expell Constantine out of Gallia, the end of Constantinus the father and Constans the sonne, the valure and prowesse of the British souldiers, the British writers reprooued of necligences for that they haue inserted fables into their woorkes, whereas they might haue deposed matters of truth.</head>
<head type="unitnum">The Xxxij. Chapter.</head>
<p>THE emperour Honorius, perceiuing the r*entity*eling state of the empire, determined, foorthwith to recouer it, before it fell altogither into ruine: and therefore sent one Constantius an earle to driue Constantine out of Gallia, which he accordinglie performed for after certeine bickerings, he slue the said Constantine at Arles, although not without great bloudshed. He pursued also the residue of the Britains, driuing them to the verie sea coasts, where they shrowded themselues among the other Britains, that before were setled in the countrie there, ancientlie called (as before we said) Armorica, that is, a region lieng on the sea coast: for <emph>Ar</emph> in the British toong signifieth vpon; and <emph>Moure,</emph> perteining to the sea. And as this Constantine the father was slaine by Constantius, so was Constans the sonne killed at Vienna by one of his owne capteines named Gerontius. Whereby it came to passe, that Honorius shortlie after, hauing thus obteined the victorie of both these vsurpers, recouered the Ile, but yet not till the yeare next following, and that by the high industrie and great diligence of that valiant gentleman earle Constantius. The slaughter of Constantine *entity* his sonne happened in the 1 yeare of the 297 Olympiad, 465 after the comming of Caesar, 1162 after the <pb n="540"/>building of Rome, the dominicall letter being A, and the golden number 13, so that the 

<note place="marg"><date>411.</date></note>

 recouering of the Iland fell in the yeare of our Lord 411.</p>
<p>Here also is eftsoones to be considered the valure of the British souldiers, who following this last remembred Constantine the vsurper, did put the Romane state in great danger, and by force brake through into Spaine, vanquishing those that kept the streicts of the mounteins betwixt Spaine and Gallia, now called France, an exploit of no small consequence, sith thereby the number of barbarous nations got free passage to enter into Spaine, wherof insued manie battels, sacking of cities and townes, and wasting of the countries, accordinglie as the furious rage of those fierce people was mooued to put their crueltie in practise.</p>
<p>*entity* If therefore the Britaine writers had considered and marked the valiant exploits and noble enterprisee which the Brittish aids, armies and legions atchiued in seruice of the Romane emperours (by whome whilest they had the gouernement ouer this Ile, there were at sundrie times notable numbers conueied foorth into the parties of beyond the seas, as by Albinus and Constantius, also by his sonne Constantine the great, by Maximus, and by this Constantine, both of them vsurpers) if (I sale) the British writers had taken good note of the numbers of the British youth thus conueied ouer from hence, *entity* what notable exploits they boldlie attempted, *entity* no lesse manfullie atchiued, they n*entity*eded not to haue giuen eare vnto the fabulous reports forged by their Bards, of Arthur and other their princes, woorthie in d*entity*ed of verie high commendation.</p>
<p>And pitie it is, that their fame should be brought by such meanes out of credit, by the incredible and fond fables which haue b*entity*ene deuised of their acts so vnlike to be true, as the tales of Robin Hood, or the gests written by Ariost the Italian in his booke intituled "Orlando furioso," sith the same writers had otherwise true matter inough to write of concerning the worthie feats by their countriemen in those daies in forren parts boldlie enterprised, and no lesse valiantlie accomplished, as also the warres which now and then they mainteined against the Romans here at home, in times when they felt themselues oppressed by their tyrannicall gouernment, as by that which is written before of Caratacus, Voadicia, Cartimandua, Venusius, Galgagus, or Galdus (as some name him) and diuers other, who for their noble valiancies deserue as much praise, as by toong or pen is able to be expressed. But now to returne vnto the British historie: we will proc*entity*ed in order with their kings as we find them in the same mentioned, and therefore we haue thought good to speake somewhat further of Gratian, from whome we haue digressed.</p>

 Britaine, and made himselfe king therof, in the yeare 390. He was a Britaine borne, as Polydor writeth, coniecturing so, by that he is named of authors to be Municeps, that is to <pb n="541"/>saie, a fr*entity*e man of the countrie or citie where he inhabited. For his sternenesse and rough 

<note place="marg">Of the Romane souldicrs as <emph>Blondus saith.</emph></note>

 gouernement, he was of the Britains (as the histories alledge) slaine and dispatched out of the waie, after he had reigned the space of foure yeares, or rather foure moneths, as should seeme by that which is found in autentike writers. Then the forenamed kings Guantius and Melga, which (as some write) were brethren, returned into this land with their armies increased 

<note place="marg"><emph>Galfrid. Caxton.</emph></note>

 with new supplies of men of warre, as Scots, Danes, the Norwegians, and destroied the countrie from side to side. For the Britains in this season were sore inf*entity*ebled, and were 

<note place="marg"><emph>Galfrid. Matth. West. Caxton.</emph></note>

 not able to make anie great numbers of souldiers, by reason that Maximus had led foorth of he land the floure and chiefest choise of all the British youth into Gallia, as before ye haue heard.</p>
<p>Gyldas maketh no mention of these two kings Guanius and Melga of the Hunnes, but 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas.</emph></note>

 rehearsing this great destruction of the land, declareth (as before ye haue heard) that the Scots and Picts were the same that did all the mischiefe, whome he calleth two nations of beyond the seas, the Scots comming out of the northwest, and the Picts out of the northeast, by whome (as he saith) the land was ouerrun, and brought vnder foot manie yeares after. Therefore the Britains being thus vexed, spoiled, and cruellie persecuted by the Scots and Picts (if we shall so take tnem) sent messengers with all sp*entity*ed vnto Rome to make sute for some aid of men of war to be sent into Britaine. Wherevpon immediatlie a legion of souldiers was sent thither in the y*entity*ere 414, which easilie repelled the enimies, and chased 

<note place="marg"><date>414.</date></note>

 them backe with great slaughter, to the great comfort of the Britains, the which by this meanes were deliuered from danger of vtter destruction, as they thought.</p>
<p>But the Romans being occasioned to depart againe out of the land, appointed the Britains to make a wall (as had b*entity*ene aforetime by the emperours Adrian, Antoninus and Seuerus) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda</emph> and <emph>Polychrou.</emph></note>

 ouerthwart the countrie trom sea to sea, stretching from Penuelton vnto the citie of Aclud, whereby the enimies might be staid from entring the land: but this wall being made of turfs and sods, rather than with stones, after the departure of the Romans was easilie ouerthrowne by the Scots and Picts, which eftsoones returned to inuade the confines of the Britains, and so entring the countrie, wasted and destroied the places before them, according to their former custome. Herevpon were messengers with most lamentable letters againe dispatched 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas. Polychrom Beda. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 towards Rome for new aid against those cruell enimies, with promise, that if the Romans wouid now in this great necessitie helpe to deliuer the land, they should be assured to find the Britains euermore obedient subiects, and redie at their commandement. Valentinianus (pitieng the case of the poore Britains) appointed another legion of souldiers (of the which 

<note place="marg"><emph>Blondus.</emph> Gallio Raucenna sent into Britaine.</note>

 one Gallio of Rauenna had the leading) to go to their succours, the which arriuing in Britaine set on the enimies, and giuing them the ouerthrow, slue a great number of them, and chased the residue out of the countrie.</p>
<p>The Romans thus hauing obteined the victorie, declared to the Britains, that from thencefoorth they would not take vpon them for euerie light occasion so painefull a iournie, aleuging how there was no reason why the Romane ensignes, with such a number of men of warre, should be put to trauell so far by sea and land, for the repelling and beating backe of a sort of scatterilg rouers and pilfring th*entity*eues. Wherfore they aduised the Britains to looke to their dueties, and like men to indeuour themselues to defend their countrie by their owne force from the enimies inuasions. And because they iudged it might be an helpe to the Britains, they set in hand to build a wall yet once againe ouerthwart the Ile, in the same place where the emaperour Seuerus caused his trench and rampire to be cast. This wall A wall 

<note place="marg">A wall built ouerthwart the Iland. <emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 which the Romans now built with helpe of the Britains, was 8 foot in bredth and 12 length, trauersing the land from east to west, *entity* was made of stone.</p>
<p>After that this wall was finished, the Romans exhorted the Britains to plaie the men, and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas</emph> and <emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 shewed them the way how to make armor *entity* weapons. Besides this, on the coast of the east sea where their ships lay at rode, *entity* where it was douted that the enimies would land, they caused towers to be erected, with spaces betwixt, out of the which the seas might be discouered. These things ordered, the Romans bad the Britains farewell, not minding to 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas.</emph></note>

 <pb n="542"/>returne thither againe. The Romans then being gon out of the land, the Scots and Picts knowing thereof, by *entity* by came againe by sea, *entity* being more emboldened than before, bicause of the deniall made by the Romans to come any more to the succor of the Britains, they tooke into possession all the north and vttermost bounds of the Ie, euen vnto the foresaid 

<note place="marg">This chanced in the yere 43. as <emph>M. W.</emph> saith.</note>

 said wall, therein to remaine as inhabitants. And wheras the Britains got them to their wall to defend the same, that the enimies should not passe further into the countrie, they were in the end beaten from it, and diuers of them slaine, so that the Scots and Picts entred vpon them and pursued them in more cruell maner than before, so that the Britains being chased out of their cities, townes, and dwelling houses, were constreined to file into desert places, and there to remaine and liue after the maner of sauage people, and in the end began to rob and spoile one another, so to auoid the danger of staruing for lacke of food: and thus at the last the countrie was so destroied and wasted, that there was no other shift for them that was left aliue to liue by, except onelie by hunting and taking of wild 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph> Rebellion.</note>

 beasts and foules. And to augment their miserie, the commons imputing the fault to rest in the lords and gouernors, arose against them in armes, but were vanquished and easilie put to flight at two seuerall times, being beaten downe and slaine (through lacke of skill) in such numbers, especiallie the latter time, that the residue which escaped, withdrew into the craggie mounteins, where within the bushes and caues they kept themselues close, sometimes comming downe and fetching away from the heards of beasts and flocks of sh*entity*epe which belonged to the nobles and gentlemen of the countrie, great booties to relieue them withall. But at length oppressed with extreme famine, when neither part could long remaine in this state, as n*entity*eding one anothers helpe, necessitie made peace betwixt the lords 

<note place="marg">Ciuill warre decaied the force of the Britains. What mischiefe follow of ciuill warres.</note>

 and commons of the land, all iniuries being pardoned and cl*entity*erelie forgiuen. This ciuill warre decaied the force of the Britains, little lesse than the tyrannicall practises of Maximus, for by the auoiding of the commons thus out of their houses, the ground laie vntilled, whereof insued such famine for the space of thr*entity*e y*entity*eres togither, that a woonderfull number of people died for want of sustenance.</p>
<p>Thus the Britains being brought generallie into such extreame miserie, they thought good 

<note place="marg">Actius.</note>

 to trie if they might purchase some aid of that noble man Actius, which at that time remained in France as yet called Gallia, gouerning the same as lieutenant vnder the emperor Honorius: and herevpon taking counsell togither, they wrote a letter to him, the tenor whereof insueth.

<p>Notwithstanding the Britains thus sought for aid at Actius hands as then the emperours 

<note place="marg">The Britains could get no aid fro the Romans.</note>

 lieutenant, yet could they get none; either for that Actius would not, as he that passed litle how things went, bicause he bare displeasure in his mino against Valentinian as then emperor; or else for that he could not, being otherwise constreined to imploie all his forces in other places against such barbarous nations as then inuaded the Romane empire. And so by that means was Britaine lost, and the tribute which the Britains were accustomed to pay to the Romans ceassed, iust fiue hundred y*entity*eres after that Iulius Caesar first entred the Ile.</p>
<p>The Britains being thus put to their shifts, manie of them as hunger-starued were constrained to y*entity*eld themselues into the griping hands of their enimies, whereas other yet <pb n="543"/>k*entity*eping within the mounteins, woods and caues, brake out as occasion serued vpon their aduersaries, and then first (saith Gyldas) did the Britains not putting their trust in man but in God (according to the saieng of Philo, Where mans helpe faileth, it is needfull that Gods helpe be present) make slaughter of their enimies that had b*entity*ene accustomed manie y*entity*eres to rob and spoile them in maner as before is recited, and so the bold attempts of the enimies 

<note place="marg">Punishment ceaseth, but sin increaseth.</note>

 ceassed for a time, but the wickednesse of the British people ceassed not at all. The enlimies departed out of the land, but the inhabitants departed not from their naughtie dooings, being not so readie to put backe the common enimies, as to exercise ciuill warre and discord among themselues. The wicked Irish people departed home, to make returne againe within a while after. But the Picts settled themselues first at that season in the vttermost bounds of the Ile, and there continued, making insurrections oftentimes vpon their neighbours, and spoiling them of their goods.</p>
<p>This with more also hath Gyldas, and likewise Beda written of this great desolation of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Galfridus. Gyldas</emph> his words are to be considered.</note>

 the British people: wherein if the words of Gyldas be well weighed and considered, it maie lead vs to thinke, that the Scots had no habitations here in Britaine, but onelie in Ireland, till after this season, and that at this present time the Picts, which before inhabited within the Iles of Orkenie, now placed themselues in the north parts of Scotland, and after by processe of time came and nestled themselues in Louthian, in the Mers, and other countries more neere to our borders. But to proc*entity*ed.</p>
<p>The British histories affirme, that whilest the Britains were thus persecuted by these two most cruell and fierce nations the Scots and Picts, the noble and chiefest men amongst them consulted togither, *entity* concluded to send an honorable ambassage vnto Aldroenus as then 

<note place="marg">An ambassage sent from the Britains vnot Aldroenus king of Britaine in France.</note>

 king of little Britaine in Gallia, which Aldroenus was the fourth from Conan Meridoc the first king there of the British nation. Of this ambassage the archbishop of London named Guetheline or Gosseline was appointed the chiefe and principall, who passing ouer into little Britaine, and comming before the presence of Aldroenus, so declared the effect of his message, that his suit was granted.

 as also the Saxons, and especiallie in Ammianus Marcellinus, where in the beginning of his twentith booke intreating of the doings of the emperour Iulianus, he saith as followeth.</p>
<p>In this state stood things in lllyricum or Slauonia, and in the east parts, at what time Constantius bare the office of consull the tenth time, and Iulianus the third time, that is to 

<note place="marg">360.</note>

 say, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 360, when in Britaine quietnesse being disturbed by roads made by the Scots and Picts, which are wild and sauage people, the frontiers of the countrie were 

<note place="marg">Scots and Picts trouble the state of this Ile.</note>

 wasted, and feare oppressed the prouinces wearied with the heape of passed losses. The emperor [he meaneth Iulianus] as then remaining at Paris, and hauing his mind troubled with manie cares, doubted to go to the aid of them beyond the sea, as we haue shewed that Constantius did, least he should leaue them in Gallia without a ruler, the Almains being euen then prouoked and stirred vp to crueltie and warre.</p>

<note place="marg">Lupicinus sent into Britaine.</note>

<p>He thought good therefore to send Lupicinus vnto these places to bring things into frame and order, which Lupicinus was at that time master of the armorie, a warlike person and skilfull in all points of chiualrie, but proud and high-minded beyond measure, and such one as it was doubted long whether he was more couetous or cruell. Herevpon the said 

<note place="marg">Bataui now Hollanders.</note>

 Lupicinus setting forward the light armed men of the Heruli and Bataui, with dinuers companies also of the people of Mesia now called Bulgarie; when winter was well entred and come on, he came himselfe to Bulleine, and there prouiding ships, and imbarking his men, 

<note place="marg">Rutupis.</note>

 when the wind serued his purpose, he transported ouer vnto Sandwich, and so marched foorth unto London, from thence purposing to set forward, as vpon aduise taken according to the qualitie of his businesse he should thinke m*entity*et and expedient.</p>

<note place="marg">Of the dispiacing of these men the learned may s*entity*e more in <emph>Am. Mar.</emph></note>

<p>In the meane time, whilest Lupicinus was busie here in Britaine to represse the enimies, the emperour Constantius displaced certeine officers, and among other he depriued the same Lupicinus of the office of the master of the armorie, appointing one Gumobarius to succ*entity*ed him in that roome, before anie such thing was knowen in these parties. And where it was doubted least that Lupicinus (if he had vnderstood so much whilest he was yet in Britaine) would haue attempted some new trouble, as he was a man of a stout and loftie mind, he was called backe from thence, and withall there was sent a notarie vnto Bulleine, to watch that none should passe the seas ouer into Britaine till Lupicinus were returned: and so returning ouer from thence yer he had anie knowledge what was doone by the emperour, he could make no sturre, hauing no such assistants in Gallia, as it was thought Ile might haue had in Britaine, if he should haue mooued rebellion there.</p>

<p>The same Marcellinus speaking of the doings about the time that Valentinianus, being 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ammianus Marcellinus lib.</emph> 26.</note>

 elected emperour, had admitted his brother Valens as fellow with him in gouernement, hath these words. In this season as though trumpets had blowne the sound to battell through out the whole Romane empire, most cruell nations being stirred vp, inuaded the borders 

<note place="marg">The Almans. The Sarmatians. The Quadi Picts and Saxons. Austorians. The Goths.</note>

 next adioining, the Almans wasted and destroied the parts of Gallia and Rhetia, as the Sarmatians and Quadi did Paunonia, the Picts, the Saxons, the Scots, and the Attacots vexed the Britains with continuall troubles, and gr*entity*euous damages; the Austorians and the people of the Moores ouerran the countrie of Affrike more sharpelie than il time past they had done; the pilfring troops of the Goths spoiled Thracia; the king of Persia set in hand to subdue the Armenians, and sought to bring them vnder his obeisance, hasting with all sp*entity*ed toward Numonia, pretending (though vniustlie) that now after the deceasse of Iouinius, with whome he had contracted a league and bond of peace, there was no cause of let what he ought not to recouer those things, which (as he alledged) did belong to his ancestors: and so foorth.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Lib.</emph> 27.</note>

<p>Moreouer, the same Marcellinus in another place writeth in this wise, where he speaketh <pb n="545"/>of the said Valentinianus Departing therefore from Amiens, and hasting to Trier, he was troubled with gr*entity*euous newes that were brought him, giuing him to vnderstand, that Britaine by a conspiracie of the barbarous nations was brought to vtter pouertie, that Nectaridus one 

<note place="marg">Comes maritimi tractus.</note>

 of the emperours house earle of the sea coast, hauing charge of the parties towards the sea, was slaine, and that the generall Bulchobaudes was circumuented by traines of the enimies. These things with great horrour being knowne, he sent Seuerus as then erie, or (as I may call him lord steward of his houshold) to reforme things that were amisse, if hap would 

<note place="marg">Comes domesticorum.</note>

 so permit, who being shortlie called backe, Iouinius going thither, and with sp*entity*ed hasting forward, sent for more aid and a great power of men, as the instant necessitie then required. At length, for manie causes, and the same greatlie to be feared, the which were reported and aduertised out of that Ile, Theodosius was elected and appointed to go thither, a man of 

<note place="marg">Theodosius sent into Britaine.</note>

 approoued skill in warlike affaires, and calling togither an hardie youthfull number of the lerions and cohorts of men of warre, he went foorth, no small hope being conceiued of his good sp*entity*ed; the fame wherof spred and went afore him.</p>
<p>A litle after, Marcellinus adding what people they were that troubled the Britains in this wise, saith thus. This shall suffice to be said, that in this season the Picts diuided into two 

<note place="marg">Picts diuided into two nations. Attacotti.</note>

 nations Dicalidones, and Victuriones, and in like maner the Attacotti a right warlike nation, and the Scots wandering here and there, made fowle woorke in places where they came. The confines of France were disquieted by the Frankeners and Saxons borderers vnto them, euerie one as they could breaking foorth, *entity* dooing great harme by cruell spoile, fire, and taking of prisoners. To withstand those dooings if good fortune would giue him leaue, that most able capteine going vnto the vttermost bounds of the earth, when he came to the 

<note place="marg">Theodosius passeth ouer into Britaine.</note>

 coast of Bullen which is seuered from the contrarie coast on the other side by the sea, with a narrow streight, where sometime the water goeth verie high and rough, *entity* shortlie after becommeth calme *entity* pleasant, without hurt to those that passe the same, transporting ouer at leasure, he arriued at Sandwich (or rather Richburrow) where there is a quiet road for vessels to Ile at anchor. Wherevpon the Bataui and Heruli, with the souldiers of the legions 

<note place="marg">Bataui Hollanders.</note>

 called Iouij, and Victores, being companies that trusted well to their owne strength, marched foorth *entity* drew towards London, an ancient citie, which now of late hath bin called Augusta. 

<note place="marg">London called Augusta.</note>

 Herewith diuiding his armie into sundrie parts, he set vpon the troops of his enimies as they were abroad to forrey the countrie, pestered with burdens of their spoiles and pillage, and sp*entity*edilie putting them to flight, as they were leading away those prisoners which they had taken, with their booties of cattell, he bereft them of their preie, the which the poore Britains that were tributaries had lost. To be briefe, restoring the whole, except a small portion bestowed amongst the wearie souldiers, he entred the citie which before was opprest with troubles, but now suddenlie refreshed, bicause there was hope of reliefe and assured preseruation.</p>
<p>After this, when Thecdosius was comforted with prosperous succasse to attempt things of greater importance, and searching waies how with good aduise to woorke suerlie: whilest he remained doubtfull what would insue, he learned as well by the confession of prisoners taken, as also by the information of such as were fled from the enimies, that the scattered people of sundrie nations which with practise of great crueltie were become fierce and vndanted, could not be subdued but by policie secretlie practised, and sudden inuasions. At length therefore setting foorth his proclamations, and promising pardon to those that were gone awaie from their capteins or charge, he called them backe againe to serue: and also those that by licence were departed and laie scattered here and there in places abroad. By this meanes, when manie were returned, he being on the one side earnestlie prouoked, and on the other holden backe with thoughtfull cares, required to haue one Ciuilis by name sent 

<note place="marg">Theodosius requireth to haue Cinilis sent to him. Dulcitius.</note>

 to him to haue the rule of the prouinces in Britaine in steed of the other gouernours, a man of sharpe wit, and an earnest mainteiner of iustice. He likewise required that one Dulcitius a capteine renowmed in knowledge of warlike affaires might be sent ouer to him for his better asistance. These things were doone in Britaine.</p>

<pb n="546"/>
<p>Againe, in his eight and twentith booke, the same Marcellinus reciting further what the same Theodosius atchiued in Britaine, hath in effect these words: Thedosius verelie a capteine 

<note place="marg">London called Augusta.</note>

 of woorthie fame, taking a valiant courage to him, and departing from Augusta, which men of old time called London, with souldiers assembled by great diligence, did succour and rel*entity*eue greatlie the decaied and troubled state of the Britains, preuenting euerie conuenient place where the barbarous people might Ile in wait to doo mischiefe: and nothing he commanded the meane souldiers to doo, but that whereof he with a ch*entity*erefull mind would first take in hand to shew them an example. By this meanes accomplishing the roome of a valiant souldier, and fulfilling the charge of a noble capteine, he discomfited and put to flight sundrie nations, whome presumption (nourished by securitie) emboldened to inuade the Romane prouinces: and so the cities and castels that had b*entity*ene sore endamaged by manifold losses and displeasures, were restored to their former state of wealth, the foundation of rest and quietnesse being laid for a long season after to insue.</p>
<p>But as these things were a dooing, one wicked practise was in hand *entity* like to haue burst foorth, to the gr*entity*euous danger of setting things in broile, if it had not b*entity*ene staied euen in 

<note place="marg">Valentinus. Valeria now Stiermarke.</note>

 the beginning of the first attempt. For there was one Valentinus, borne in the parties of Valeria adioining to Pannonia, now called Stiermarke, a man of a proud and loftie stomach, brother to the wife of Maximinus, which Valentinus for some notable offense had b*entity*ene banished into Britaine, where the naughtie man that could not rest in quiet, deuised how by some commotion he might destroy Theodosius, who as he saw was onelie able to resist his wicked purposes. And going about manie things both priuilie and apertlie, the force of his vnmeasurable desire to mischiefe still increasing, he sought to procure aswell other that were in semblable wise banished men, *entity* inclined to mischiefe like him selfe, as also diuers of the souldiers, alluring them (as the time serued) with large promises of great wealth, if they would ioine with him in that enterprise. But euen now in the verie nicke, when they shuld haue gone in hard with their vngratious exploit, Theodosius warned of their intent, boldlie aduanced himselfe to s*entity*e due punishment executed on the offendors that were foorthwith taken and knowne to be guiltie in that conspiracie.</p>

<note place="marg">Dulcitius is appointed to put Valentinus to death.</note>

<p>Theodosius committed Valentine with a few other of his trustie complices vnto the capteine Dulcitius, commanding him to see them put to death: but coniecturing by his warlike skill (wherein he passed all other in those daies) what might follow, he would not in anie wise haue anie further inquirie made of the other conspirators, least through feare that might be spread abroad in manie, the troubles of the prouinces now well quieted, should be againe reuiued. After this, Theodosius disposing himselfe to redresse manie things as n*entity*ed required, all danger was quite remooued: so that it was most apparent, that fortune fauored him in such wise, that she left him not destitute of hir furtherance in anie one of all his attempts. He therefore restored the cities *entity* castels that were appointed to be kept with garrisons, and the borders he caused to be defended and garded with sufficient numbers to k*entity*epe watch and ward in places necessarie. And hauing recouered the prouince which the enimies had gotten into their possession, he so restored it to the former state, that vpon 

<note place="marg">A part of Britaine called Valentia.</note>

 his motion to haue it so, a lawfull gouernour was assigned to rule it, and the name was changed, so as from thencefoorth it should be called Valentia for the princes pleasure.</p>
<p>The Areani, a kind of men ordined in times past by our elders (of whome somewhat we haue spoken in the acts of the emperour Constance) being now by little and little fallen into vices, he remooued from their places of abiding, being openlie conuicted, that allured with bribes and faire promises, they had oftentimes bewraied vnto the barbarous nations what was doone among the Romans: for this was their charge, to runne vp and downe by long iournies, and to giue warning to our captains, what sturre the people of the next confines were about to make.</p>

<note place="marg">The praise of Theodosius.</note>

<p>Theodosius therefore hauing ordered these *entity* other like things, most woorthilie *entity* to his high fame, was called home to the emperours court, who leauing the prouinces in most triumphant state, was highlie renowmed for his often and most profitable victories, as if he <pb n="547"/>had b*entity*ene another Camillus or Cursor Papirius, and with the fauor and loue of all men was conueied vnto the sea side; and passing ouer with a gentle wind, came to the court, where he was receiued with great gladnesse and commendation, being immediatlie appointed to succ*entity*ed in the roome of Valence Iouinus that was maister of the horsses. Finallie, he was called by the emperour Gratianus, to be associated with him in the imperiall estate, after the death of Valence, in the yeare after the incarnation of our Sauior 379 and reigned emperour,

<note place="marg">Seuerus.</note>

 consuls, there brake forth a multitude of Saxons, *entity* passing the seas, entred stronglie into the Romane confines: a nation fed oftentimes with the slaughter of our people, the brunt of whose first inuasion earle Nonneus susteined, one which was appointed to defend those 

<note place="marg">Nonucus Comes.</note>

 parties, an approoued capteine, *entity* with continuall trauell in warres verie expert. But then incountring with desperate and forlorne people, when he perceiued some of his souldiers to be ouerthrowne and beaten downe, and himselfe wounded, not able to abide the often assaults of his enimlies, he obteined this by informing the emperour what was necessarie and ought to be doone, insomuch that Seuerus, maister or (as I maie call him) coronell of the 

<note place="marg">Seuerus coronell of the footmen.</note>

 footmen, was sent to helpe and rel*entity*eue things that stood in danger: the which bringing a sufficient power with him for the state of that businesse, when he came to those places, he diuiding his armie into parts, put the Saxons in such feare and trouble before they fought, that they did not so much as take weapon in hand to make resistance, but being amazed with the sight of the glittering ensignes, *entity* the eagles figured in the Romane standards, they streight made sute for peace, and at length after the matter was debated in sundrie wise (because it was iudged that it should be profitable for the Romane commonwealth) truce was granted vnto them, and manie yoong men (able for seruice in the warres) deliuered to the Romans according to the couenants concluded.</p>
<p>After this the Saxons were permitted to depart without impeachment, *entity* so to returne from whence they came, who being now out of all feare, and preparing to go their waies, diuers bands of footmen were sent to Ile priuilie in a certeine hid vallie so ambushed, as they might easilie breake foorth vpon the enimies as they passed by them. But it chanced far otherwise than they supposed, for certeine of those footmen stirred with tie noise of them as they were comming, brake foorth out of time, and being suddenlie discouered whitest they hasted to vnite and knit themselues togither, by the hideous crie and shout of the Saxons they were put to flight. Yet by and by closing togither againe, they staied, and the extremitie of the chance ministring to them force (though not sufficient) they were driuen to fight it out, and being beaten downe with great slaughter, had died euerie mothers sonne, if a troope of horssemen armed at all points (being in like maner placed in an other side at the entring of the waie to assaile the enimies as they should passe) aduertised by the dolefull noise of them that fought, had not sp*entity*edilie come to the succour of their fellowes.</p>
<p>Then ran they togither more cruellie than before, and the Romans bending themselues towards their enimies, compassed them in on each side, and with drawne swords slue them downe right, so that there was not one of them left to returne home to their natiue countrie to bring newes how they had sped, nor one suffered to liue after anothers death, either to reuenge their ruine, or to lament their losse. Thus were the limits of the Romnane empire preserued at that time in Britaine, which should s*entity*eme to be about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 399.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>399.</date></note>

<p>*entity* Thus were the Romans, as commonlie in all their martiall affaires, so in this incounter verie fortunate, the happie issue of the conflict falling out on their side. And strange it is to consider and marke, how these people by a celestiall kind of influence were begotten and <pb n="548"/>borne borne as it were to prowesse and renowme; the course of their dealings in the field most aptlie answering to their name. For (as some suppose) the Romans were called of the

 Gr*entity*eke word <foreign lang="greek">r(w/mh,</foreign> signifieng power and mightinesse: and in old time they were called Valentians, <emph>A valendo,</emph> of preuailing: so that it was no maruell though they were victorious subduers of forren people, sithens they were by nature created and appointed to be conquerors, and thereof had their denomination.</p>

<p>*entity* Thus much haue we thought good to gather out of the Romane and other writers, that ye might perceiue the state of Britaine the better in that time of the decaie of the Romane empire, and that ye might haue occasion to marke by the waie, how not onelie the Scots, but also the Saxons had attempted to inuade the Britains, before anie mention is made of the same their attempts by the British and English writers. But whether the Scots had anie habitation within the bounds of Britaine, till the time supposed by the Briraine writers, we leaue that point to the iudgement of others that be trauelled in the search of such antiquities, onclie admonishing you, that in the Scotish chronicle you shall find the opinion which their writers haue conceiued of this matter, and also manie things touching the acts of the Romans doone against diuerse of the Britains, which they presume to be doone against their nation, though shadowed vnder the generall name of Britains, or of other particular names, at this daie to most men vnknowne. But whensoeuer the Scots came into this Ile, they made the third nation that inhabited the same, comming first out of Scithia, or rather out of Spaine

 request of the archbishop of London, made in name of all the Britains in the Ile of great Britaine, was sent into the same Ile by his said brother Aldroenus vpon couenants ratified in manner as before is recited, and brought with him a conuenient power, landing with the same at Totnesse in Deuonshire. Immediatlie after his c*entity*ming on land, he gathered to him 

<note place="marg"><emph>Caxton</emph> saith 12000. but <emph>Gal.</emph> and others say but 2000.</note>

 a great power of Britains, which before his landing were hid in diuerse places of the Ile. Then went he foorth with them, and gaue battell to the enimies, whom he vanquished: *entity* slue that tyrannicall king Guanius there in the field (as some bookes haue.) Howbeit, this 

<note place="marg">The British historie disagreeth from the Scotish.</note>

 agr*entity*eth not with the Scotish writers, which affirme that they got the field, but yet lost their king named Dongard (as in their historie ye maie read.)</p>
<p>But to proc*entity*ed as our writers report the matter. When the Britains had thus ouercome their enimies, they conueied their capteine the said Constantine vnto Cicester, and there in fulfiling their promise and couenant made to his brother, crowned him king of great Britaine, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 433, which was about the fift y*entity*ere of the emperour Valentinianus the second, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith 435.</note>

 and third y*entity*ere of Clodius king of the Frankners after called Frenchmen, which then began to settle themselues in Gallia, whereby the name of that countrie was afterwards changed and called France. Constantine being thus established king, ruled the land well and noblie, and defended it from all inuasion of enimies during his life. He begat of his wife thr*entity*e sonnes (as the British historie affirmeth) Constantius, Aurelius Ambrosius, and Vter surnamed <pb n="552"/>Penlragon. The eldest, bicause he perceiued him to be but dull of wit, and not verie toward, he made a moonke, placing him within the abbie of Amphibalus in Winchester.</p>

	  <note place="marg">In a groue of bushes as <emph>Cal.</emph> saith. <emph>Matth. West. Beda. <unclear>O osius.</unclear> Bloadws.</emph></note>

<p>Finallie this Constantine, after he had reigned ten y*entity*eres, was traitorouslie slaie one day in his owne chamber (as some write) by a Pict, who was in such fauor with him, that he might at all times haue fr*entity*e accesse to him at his pleasure. Neither the Romane writers, nor Beda, make anie mention of this Constantine: but of the other Constantine they write, which immediatlie after the vsurper Gratian was dispatched out of the way (as before ye haue heard) was aduanced to the rule of this land, and title of emperour, onelie in hope of his name, and for no other respect of towardnesse in him, afore time being but a meane souldier, without anie degr*entity*e of honour. The same Constantine (as writers record) going ouer into Gallia, adorned his sonne Constantius with the title and dignitie of Cesar, the which before was a moonke, and finallie as well the one as the other were slaine, the father at Arles by earle Constantius, that was sent against him by the emperour Honorius; and the sonne at Vienna (as before ye haue heard) by one of his owne court called Gerontius (as in the Italian historie ye may s*entity*e more at large.) This chanced about the yeere of our 

<note place="marg"><date>415.</date></note>

 Lord 415.</p>
<p>*entity* This haue we thought good to repeat in this place, for that some may suppose that this Constantine is the same that our writers take to be the brother of Aldroenus king of little Britaine, as the circumstance of the time and other things to be considered may giue them occasion to thinke, for that there is not so much eredit to be y*entity*elded to them that haue written the British histories, but that in some part men may with iust cause doubt of sundrie matters conteined in the same: and therfore haue we in this booke b*entity*ene the more diligent to shew what the Romans and other forreine writers haue registred in their bookes of histories touching the affaires of Britaine, that the reader may be the better satisfied in the truth. But now to returne to the sequele of the historie as we find the same written by the British chroniclers.</p>

<note place="marg">This Vortigerne was duke of the Geuisses and Cornewall, as <emph>Rad. Cestr.</emph> reporteth. <emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

<p>After that Constantine was murthered (as before ye haue heard) one Vorigerus, or Vortigernus, a man of great authoritie amongst the Britains, wrought so with the residue of the British nobilitie, that Constantius the eldest sonne of their king the fore-remembred Constantine, was taken out of the abbie of Winchester where he remained, and was streightwaies created king, as lawfull inheritour to his father.</p>
<p>Ye haue heard how Constantius was made a moonke in his fathers life time, bicause he was thought to be too soft and childish in wit, to haue anie publike rule committed to his hands: but for that cause speciallie did Vortigerne s*entity*eke t'aduance him, to the end that the king being not able to gouerne of himselfe, he might haue the chiefest swaie, and so rule all things as it were vnder him, preparing thereby a way for himselfe to atteine at length to the kingdome as by that which followed was more apparentlie perceiued.</p>

<note place="marg">CONST ANTIUS. <emph>Matt. West.</emph> saith 445.</note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">THIS</hi> Constantius then the sonne of Constantine, by the helpe (as before ye haue heard) of Vortigerne, was made king of Britaine, in the yere of our Lord 443. But Constantius bare but the name of king: for Vortigerne abusing his innocencie and simple discretion to order things as was requisite, had all the rule of the land, and did what pleased him. Wherevpon first, where there had b*entity*ene a league concluded betwixt the Britains, Scots and Picts, in the daies of the late king Constantine, Vortigerne caused the same league to be 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 renewed, *entity* waged an hundred Picts, and as manie Scots to be attendant as a gard vpon the kings person, diuers of the which (corrupting them with faire promises) he procured by 

<note place="marg">Constantius murthered.</note>

 subtile meanes in the end to murther the king, and immediatlie vpon the deed doone, he caused the murtherers to be strangled, that they should not afterwards disclose by whose 

<note place="marg">The subtile dealing of Vortigerne.</note>

 procurement they did that d*entity*ed. Then caused he all the residue of the Scots and Picts to be apprehended, and as it had b*entity*ene vpon a zeale to s*entity*e the death of Constantius seuerelie punished, he framed such inditements and accusations against them, that chieflie by his meanes (as appeared) the giltlesse persons were condemned and hanged, the multitude of <pb n="553"/>the British people b*entity*eing woonderfullie pleased therewith, and giuing great commendations to Vortigerne for that d*entity*ed. Thus Constantius was made awaie in maner as before ye haue heard, after he had reigned (as most writers affirme) the space of flue y*entity*eres.</p>
<p>After his death was knowne, those that had the bringing vp and custodie of his two

 yoonger brethren, Aurelius Ambrose, and Vter Pendragon, mistrusting the wicked intent of Vortigerne, whose dissimulation and mischieuous meaning by some great likelihoods they suspected, with all sp*entity*ed got them to the sea, and fled into litle Britaine, there k*entity*eping them till it pleased God otherwise to prouide for them. But Vortigerne could so well dissemble his craftie workings, and with such conueiance and cloked maner could shadow and colour the matter, that most men thought and iudged him verie innocent and void of euill meaning: insomuch that he obteined the fauour of the people so greatlie, that he was reputed for the onelie staie and defender of the common wealth. Herevpon it came to passe, that when the councell was assembled to elect a new king, for so much as the other sonnes of king Constantine were not of age sufficient to rule, Vortigerne himselfe was chosen, diuers of the 

<note place="marg">Vortigerne chosen king of Britaine.</note>

 nobles (whom he had procured thereto) giuing their voices to this his preferment, as to one best deseruing the same in their opinion and iudgement. This Vorigerne, as by indirect meanes and sinister proc*entity*edings he aspired to the regiment, hauing no title therevnto, otherwise than as blind fortune vouchsafed him the preferment: so when he was possssed, but not interessed in the same, he vncased the crooked conditions which he had couertlie concealed, and in the end (as by the sequele you shall s*entity*e) did pull shame and infamie vpon himselfe.</p>

 4112 of the world, the dominicall letter going by F, the prime by 10, which fell about the 21 y*entity*ere of the emperour Valentinianus, the same y*entity*ere that Meroneus began to reigne ouer the Frenchmen. Before he was made king, he was earle or duke of the Geuisses, a people which held that part of Britaine where afterwards the west Saxons inhabited. Now when 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 he had with treason, fraud, and great deceit at length obteined that for the which he had long looked, he first of all furnished the tower of London with a strong garrison of men of warre.</p>
<p>Then studieng to aduance such onelie as he knew to be his speciall friends and fauourers, he sought by all meanes how to oppresse other, of whose good will he had neuer so litle 

<note place="marg"><date>415.</date></note>

 mistrust, and namelie those that were affectionate towards the linage of Constantine he hated deadlie, and deuised by secret meanes which way he might best destroy them. But these his practises being at the first perceiued, caused such as had the gouernance of the two yoong gentlemen with all sp*entity*ed to get them ouer (as ye haue heard) into Britaine Armorike, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 there to remaine out of danger with their vncle the king of that land. Diuers of the <pb n="554"/>Britains Britains also, that knew themselues to be in Vortigerne his displeasure, sailed ouer dailie vnto them, which thing brought Vortigerne into great doubt and feare of his estate.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas.</emph></note>

<p>It chanced also the same time that there was great plentie of come, *entity* store of fruit, the 

<note place="marg">Pientie of wealth accompanied with store of sinnes.</note>

 like wherof had not b*entity*ene seene in manie y*entity*eres before, and therevpon insued riot, strife lecherie, and other vices verie heinous, *entity* yet accounted as then for small or rather none offenses at all. These abuses *entity* great enormities reigned not onelie in the temporaltie, but also in the spiritualtie and ch*entity*efe rulers in the same: so that euerie man turned the point of his speare (euen as he had consented of purpose) against the true and innocent person. The commons also gaue themselues to voluptuous lust, drunkennesse, and idle loitering, whereof followed fighting, contention, enuie, and much debate. Of this plentie therefore insued great pride, and of this abundance no lesse hautinesse of mind, wherevpon followed great wickednesse, lacke of good gouernement and sober temperancie, and in the necke of these as a iust punishment, death and mortalitie, so that in some countries scarse the quicke sufficed to burie the dead.</p>

<note place="marg">Seots and Picts inuade the Britains.</note>

<p>And for an augmentation of more misch*entity*efe, the Scots and Picts hearing how their countrimen through the false suggestion of Vortigerne, had bene wrongfullie and most cruellie put to death at London, began with fire *entity* sword to make sharpe *entity* cruell warre against the Britains, wasting their countrie, spoiling and burning their townes, and giuing them the ouerthrow in a pitcht field, as in the Scotish historie more plainlie appeareth. To be br*entity*efe, the Britains were brought into such danger and miserie, that they knew not what way to take for remedie in such present perill, likelie to be ouerrun and vtterlie vanquished of their enimies. In the meane time Vortigerne not onelie troubled with these imminent euils, but fearing also the returne of the two brethren, Aurelius Ambrose, and Vter Pendragon, began to consider of the state of things, and est*entity*eming it most sure to worke by aduise, called togither the principall lords and ch*entity*efe men of the realme to haue their counsell and opinion, how to proc*entity*ed in such a weightie businesse: and so debating the matter with them, measured both his owne force, and also the force of his enimies, and according to the condition and state of the time, diligentlie considered and searched out what remedie was to be had and prouided.</p>

<p>At length after they had throughlie pondered all things, the more part of the nobles with the king also were of this mind, that there could be no better way deuised, than to send into Germanie for the Saxons to come to their aid: the which Saxons in that season were highlie renowmed for their valiancie in armes, and manifold aduentures heretofore atchiued, And so forthwith messengers were dispatched into Germanie, the which with monie, gifts, and promises, might procure the Saxons to come to the aid of the Britains against the Scots and Picts. The Saxons glad of this message, as people desirous of intertainment to serue in warres, choosing forth a picked companie of lustie yoong men vnder the leading of two brethren Hingist and Horsus, got them aboord into certeine vessels appointed for the purpose, and so with all sp*entity*ed directed their course towards great Britaine.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>449.</date></note>

<p>This was in the yeare of our Lord 449, and in the second yeare of Vortigerns reigne, as the most autentike writers both British and English s*entity*eme to gather, although the Scotish 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 writers, and namelie, Hector Boetius doo varie herein, touching the iust account of yeares, as to the perusers of the writings aswell of the one as the other may appeare. But others take it to be in the 4 y*entity*ere of his reigne: whereto Beda s*entity*emeth to agr*entity*e, who noteth it in the same yeare that Martianus the emperour began to rule the empire, which was (as appeareth by the consularie table) in the consulship of Protogenes and Austerius, and third yeere of Meroneus king of France.</p>
<p>These Saxons thus arriuing in Britaine, were courteouslie receiued, *entity* hartilie welcomed of king Vortigerne, who assigned to them places in Kent to inhabit, and foorthwith led them against the Scots and Picts, which were entred into Britaine, wasting *entity* destroieng the countrie before them. H*entity*erevpon comming to ioine in battell, there was a sore fight betwixt the parties for a while. But at length when the Saxons called to their remembrance <pb n="555"/>that the same was the day which should either purchase to them an euerlasting name of manhood by victorie, or else of reproch by repulse, began to renew the fight with such violence, 

<note place="marg">Scots Vanquished by the Saxons.</note>

 that the enimies not able to abide their fierce charge, were scattered and beaten downe on ech side with great slaughter.</p>
<p>The king hauing gotten this victorie, highlie rewarded the strangers according to their well deseruings, as by whose prowesse he had thus vanquished his enimies, which (as some write) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henrie Hunt.</emph></note>

 were come as farre as Stamford, and vsed at that time to fight with long darts and speares, whereas the Saxons fought onelie with long swords and axes.</p>
<p>*entity* Some haue written that the Saxons were not sent for, but came by chance into the Ile, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 and the occasion to be this. There was an ancient custome among the English Saxons a people in Germanie, as was also at the first among other nations, that when the multitude of them was so increased, that the countrie was not able to susteine and find them, by commandement of their princes, they should choose out by lots a number of yoong and able personages fit for the warrs, which should go foorth to s*entity*eke them new habitations: and so it chanced to these, that they came into great Britaine, and promised to serue the king for wages in his warres.</p>

<div2 type="chapter" n="3">
<head type="title"> Hengistus the Saxon shooteth at the crowne and scepter of the kingdome by craftie and subtile practises, a great number of forren people arriue in Britaine for the augmentation of his power, of the faire ladie Rowen his daughter, whereof Wednesdaie and Fridaie tooke their name, of the Iutes, Saxons, and Angles, Vortigerne being inflamed with the loue of Henrgists daughter forsaketh his owne wife and marrieth hir, Vortigerne giueth Hengist all Kent, the Saxons come ouer by heaps to inhabit the land, the British nobilitie moue the king to auoid them, he is depriued of his kingdome, the miserable destruction made by the Saxons in this land, skirmishes betwixt them and the Britains.</head>

<p>NOW Hengistus, being a man of great wit, rare policie, and high wisedome, vnderstanding 

<note place="marg">Hengist purposeth at the first to conquere quere the Britains.</note>

 the kings mind, who wholie trusted to the valiancie of the Saxons, *entity* herewithall perceiuing the fruitfulnesse of the countrie, presentlie began to consider with himselfe, by what wiles and craft he might by little little settle heere, and obteine a kingdome in the lie, and so establish the same to him and his for euer.</p>
<p>Therefore first he endeuored with all speed possible to fense that part of the countrie, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 which was giuen him and his people, and to inlarge and furnish it with garisons appointed in places most conuenient. After this he did what he could to persuade the king, that a great power of men might be brought ouer out of Germanie, that the land being fortified with such strength, the enimies might be put in feare, and his subiects holden in rest. The king not

 fores*entity*eing the hap that was to come, did not despise this counsell tending to the destruction of his kingdome, and so was more aid sent for into Germanie: wherevpon now at this second time there arriued heere 16 vessels fraught with people, and at the same time came the ladie Rowen or Ronix (daughter to Hengist) a maid of excellent beautie and comelinesse, able to delight the eies of them that should behold hir, and speciallie to win the heart of Vortigerne with the dart of concupiscence, wherevnto he was of nature much inclined, and that did Hengist well perceiue.</p>
<p>There came ouer into this land at that time and soone after, thr*entity*e maner of people of the Germane nation, as Saxons, Vitae or Iutes, and Angles, ouer the which the said Hengist and 

<note place="marg">The <emph>Vitae</emph> or <emph>Iutae</emph> are called Ibitti. <emph>Alex. Now.</emph></note>

 Horse being brethren, were capteines *entity* rulers, men of right noble parentage in their countries, as descended of that ancient. prince Woden, of whom the English Saxon kings doo for the more <pb n="556"/>part fetch their pedegr*entity*e, as lineallie descended from him. vnto whome also the English people (falselie reputing him for a god) consecrated the fourth daie of the w*entity*eke, as they did the sixt to his wife Frea: so that the same daies tooke name or them, the one being called Wodensdaie, 

<note place="marg">Wedesdaie, and Fridaie, whereof they came.</note>

 densdaie, and the other Freadaie, which woords after in continuance of time by corruption of sp*entity*ech were somewhat altered, though not much, as from Wodensdaie, to Wednesdaie, and from Freadaie to Fridaie. The foresaid Woden was father to Vecta, the father of Wergistus 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 that was father to the foresaid Hengistus and Horsus.</p>
<p>But now to rehearse further touching those thr*entity*e people which at this time came ouer into Britaine out of Germanie. Of the Vites or Iutes (as Beda recordeth) are the Kentishmen descended, and the people of the Ile of Wight, with those also that inhabit ouer against the same Ile. Of the Saxons came the east, the south, *entity* the west Saxons. Moreouer, of the Angles proc*entity*eded the east Angles, the middle Angles or Mercies, and the Northerne men. That 

<note place="marg"><emph>Cox. Tacitus</emph></note>

 these Angles were a people of Germanie, it appeareth also by Cornelius Tacitus, who called them Anglij, wh ch word is of thr*entity*e syllables (as Polydor saith:) but some write it Angli with two syllables. And that these Angli, or Anglij were of no small force and authoritie in Germanie before their comming into this land, maie appeare, in that they are numbred amongst the twelue nations there, which had lawes and ancient ordinances apart by themselues, according to the which the state of their common wealth was gouerned, they being the same and one people with the Thuringers, as in the title of the old Thuringers lawes we find recorded, which is thus: "Lex Angliorum *entity* Werinorum, hoc est Thuringorum," The law of the Angles and Werinians that is to saie the Thuringers, which Thuringers are a people in Saxonie, as in the description of that countrie it maie appeare.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> Rowen, or Ronowen Hengists daughter.</note>

<p>But now to the matter. Hengist perceiuing that his people were highlie in Vortigernes fauour, began to handle him craftilie, deuising by what means he might bring him in loue with his daughter Ronix, or Rowen, or Ronowen (as some write) which he bel*entity*eued well would easilie be brought to passe, bicause he vnderstood that the king was much giuen to sensuall lust, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 which is the thing that often blindeth wise mens vnderstanding, and maketh them to dote, and to lose their perfect wits: yea, and oftentimes bringeth them to destruction, though by such pleasant poison they f*entity*ele no bitter taste, till they be brought to the extreame point of confusion in d*entity*ed.</p>
<p>A great supper therefore was prepared by Hengist, at the which it pleased the king to be 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 present, and appointed his daughter, when euerie man began to be somewhat merrie with drinke, to bring in a cup of gold full of good and pleasant wine, and to present it to the king, saieng; Wassail. Which she did in such comelie and decent maner, as she that knew how to doo it well inough, so as the king maruelled greatlie thereat, and not vnderstanding what she ment by that salutation, demanded what it signified. To whom it was answered by 

<note place="marg">Wassail, what it signifieth.</note>

 Hengist, that she wished him well, and the meaning of it was, that he should drinke after hir, ioining thereto this answer, Drinke haile. Wherevpon the king (as he was informed) tooke the cup at the damsels hand, and dranke.</p>
<p>Finallie, this yoong ladie behaued hir selfe with such pleasant woords, comelie countenance, and amiable grace, that the king beheid hir so long, till he felt himselfe so farre in loue with hir person, that he burned in continuall desire to inioy the same: insomuch that shortlie after 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor. Fabian.</emph></note>

 he forsooke his owne wife, by the which he had thr*entity*e sonnes, named Vortimerus, Catagrinus, and Pascentius, and required of Hengist to haue his daughter, the said Rowen, or Ronowen in mariage. Hengist at the first s*entity*emed strange to grant to his request, and excused the

 matter, for that his daughter was not of estate and dignitie m*entity*et to be matched with his maiestie. But at length as it had b*entity*ene halfe against his will he consented, and so the mariage was concluded *entity* solemnized, all Kent being assigned vnto Hengist in reward, the which countrie was before that time gouerned by one Guorongus (though not with most equall iustice) which Guorongus was subiect vnto Vortigerne, as all other the potentats of the Iie were.</p>
<p>This mariage and liberalitie of the king towards the strangers much offended the minds of his subiects, and hastened the finall destruction of the land. For the Saxons now vnderstanding <pb n="557"/>the affinitie had betwixt the king and Hengist, came so fast ouer to inhabit h*entity*ere, that it was woonder to consider in how short a time such a multitude could come togither: so that bicause of their great number and approoued puissance in warres, they began to be a terrour to the former inhabitants the Britains. But Hengist being no lesse politike in counsell than valiant 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 in armes, abusing the kings lacke of discretion, to serue his owne turne, persuaded him to call out of Germanie his brother Occa and his sonne named Ebusa, being men of great valure, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal.</emph> saith he was Hengists sonne, and Ebusa his vncles sonne. Occa and Ebusa leaders of Saxons.</note>

 to the end that as Hengist defended the land in the south part: so might they k*entity*epe backe the Scots in the north.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon by the kings consent, they came with a power out of Germanie, and coasting about the land, they sailed to the Iles of Orknie, and sore vexed the people there, and likewise the Scots and Picts also, and finallie arriued in the north parts of the realme, now called Northumberland, where they setled themselues at that present, and so continued there euer after: but none of them taking vpon him the title of king, till about 99 y*entity*eres after their first

 comming into that countrie, but in the meane time remaining as subiects vnto the Saxon kings of Kent. After their arriuall in that prouince, they oftentimes fought with the old inhabitants there, and ouercame them, chasing away such as made resistance, and appeased the residue by receiuing them vnder allegiance.</p>
<p>When the nobles of Britaine saw and perceiued in what danger the land stood, by the dailie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph> The great numbers of strangers suspected to the Britains.</note>

 repaire of the huge number of Saxons into the same, they first consulted togither, and after resorting to the king, mooued him that some order might be taken for the auoiding of them, or the more part of them, least they should with their power and great multitude vtterlie oppresse the British nation. But all was in vaine, for Vortigerne so est*entity*emed and highlie fauoured the Saxons, and namelie by reason of the great loue which he bare to his wife, that he little regarded his owne nation, no nor yet anie thing est*entity*emed his owne naturall kinsmen and chiefe friends, by reason whereof the Britains in fine depriued him of all kinglie honour, 

<note place="marg">Vortigerne depriued.</note>

 after that he had reigned 16 y*entity*eres, and in his steed crowned his sonne Vortimer.</p>
<p>Gyldas and Beda make no mention of Vortimer, but declare that after the Saxons were 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas. Beda. H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 receiued into this land there was a couenant made betwixt them and the Britains, that the Saxons should defend the countrie from the inuasion of enimies by their knightlie force: and that in consideration therof, the Britains should find them prouision of vittels: wherewith they held them contented for a time. But afterwards they began to pike quarrels, as though they were not sufficientlie furnished of their due proportion of vittels, threatening that if they were not prouided more largelie thereof, they would surelie spoile the countrie. So that without deferring of time, they performed their woords with effect of deeds, beginning in 

<note place="marg">The miserable destruction made by the Saxons in this land.</note>

 the east part of the Iie, *entity* with fire and swoord passed foorth, wasting and destroieng the countrie, till they came to the vttermost part of the west: so that from sea to sea, the land was wasted and destroied in such cruell and outragious manner, that neither citie, towne, nor church was regarded, but all committed to the fire: the priests slaine and murthered euen afore the altars, and the prelats with the people without anie reuerence of their estate or degr*entity*e dispatched with fire and swoord, most lamentablie to behold.</p>
<p>Manie of the Britains s*entity*eing the demeanour of the Saxons, fled to the mounteins, of the which diuers being apprehended, were cruellie slaine, and other were glad to come foorth and yeeld themselues to eternall bondage, for to haue rel*entity*efe of meate and drinke to asswage their extremitie of hunger. Some other got them out of the realme into strange lands, so to saue themselues; and others abiding still in their countrie, kept them within the thicke woods and craggie rocks, whither they were fled, liuing there a poore wretched life, in great feare and vnquietnesse of mind.</p>
<p>But after that the Saxons were departed and withdrawne to their houses, the Britains began to take courage to them againe, issuing foorth of those places where they had lien hid, and with one consent calling for aid at Gods hand, that they might be preserued from vtter destruction, they began vnder the conduct of their leader Aurelius Ambrose, to prouoke the Saxons to battell, and by the helpe of God they obteined victorie, according to their owne <pb n="558"/>desires. And from thence foorth, one while the Britains, and an other while the Saxons were victors. So that in this British people, God (according to his accustomed man er) as it were present Israeli, tried them from time to time, whether they loued him or no, vntill the

 made king of Britaine, in the yeare of our Lord 46, which was in the fourth yeare of the emperour Leo the fift, and about the sixt yeare of Childericus king of France, as our common account runneth, which is far disagr*entity*eing from that whereof W. Harison dooth speake

<p>But to proc*entity*ed, Vortimer being thus aduanced to the gouernment of the realme, in all hast made sore warre against the Saxons, and gaue vnto them a great battell vpon the riuer

<note place="marg">The riuer of Derwent.</note>

 of Derwent, where he had of them the vpper hand. And the second time he fought with

 them at a place called Epiford, or Aglisthrop, in the which incounter Catagrine or Catigernus the brother of Vortimer, and Horsus the brother of Hengist, after a long combat betwixt them two, either of them slue other: but the Britains obteined the field (as saith

Beside these 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian</emph> Tetford in Norfolke. Colchester.</note>

 foure principall battels, Vortimer had diuers other conflicts with the Saxons, as in Kent and at Tetford in Norfolke, also n*entity*ere to Colchester in Essex: for he left not till he had bereft them of the more part of all such possessions as before time they had got, so that they were constrained to k*entity*epe them within the Ile of Tenet, where he oftentimes assailed them with such ships as he then had. When Ronowen the daughter of Hengist perceiued the great losse that the Saxons susteined by the maruall prowesse of Vortimer, she found means that <pb n="559"/>within a while the said Vortimer was poisoned, after he had ruled the Britains by the space of 6 or 7 yeares and od moneths.</p>
<p>*entity* By the British historie it should s*entity*eme, that Vortimer before his death handled the Saxons so hardlie, k*entity*eping them besieged within the Ile of Tenet, till at length they were constrained to sue for licence to depart home into Germanie in safetie: and the better to bring this to pas, they sent Vortigerne, (whome they had kept still with them in all these battels) vnto his sonne Vortimer, to be a meane for the obteining of their sute. But whilest this treatie was in hand, they got them into their ships, and leauing their wiues and children behind them, returned into Germanie. Thus far Gal. Mon. But how vnlikelie this is to be true, I will not make anie further discourse, but onelie refer euerie man to that which in old autentike historiographers of the English nation is found recorded, as in Will. Malmes. Henr. Hunt. Marianus, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 and others: vnto whome in these matters concerning the dooings betwixt the Saxons and Britains, we male vndoubtedlie and safelie giue most credit.</p>
<p>William Malmes. writing of this Vortimer, or Guortigerne, and of the warres which he had against the Saxons, varieth in a maner altogither from Geffrey of Monmouth, as by his words here following ye maie perceiue. Guortimer, the sonne of Vortimer (saith he) thinking not good long to dissemble the matter, for that he saw himselfe and his countriemen the Britains preuented by the craft of the English Saxons, set his full purpose to driue them out of the realme, and kindled his father to the like attempt. He therefore being the author and procurer, seuen yeares after their first comming into this land, the league was broken, and by the space of 20 yeares they fought oftentimes togither in manie light incounters, but foure times 

<note place="marg">Hengist had the victorie in this battell saith <emph>Ra. Hig.</emph> Horse and Catigene slaine.</note>

 they fought puissance against puissance in open field: in the first battell they departed with like fortune, whilest the one part, that is to meane, the Saxons lost their capteine Horse that was brother to Hengist, and the Britains lost Catigerne an other of Vortigerns sonnes.</p>
<p>In the other battels, when the Englishmen went euer awaie with the vpper hand, at length 

<note place="marg"><date>458.</date></note>

 a peace was concluded, Guortimer being taken out of this world by course of fatall death, the which much differing from the soft and milde nature of his father, right noblie would haue gouerned the realme, if God had suffered him to haue liued. But these battels which Vortimer gaue to the Saxons (as before is mentioned) should appeare by that which some writers haue recorded, to haue chanced before the supposed time of Vortimers or Guortimers atteining to the crowne, about the 6 or 7 yeare after the first comming of the Saxons into this realme with Hengist. And hereto X. Harison giueth his consent, referring the mutuall slaughter of Horsus and Catigerne to the 6 years of Martianus, *entity* 455 of Christ. Howbeit 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 Polydor Virgil saith, that Vortimer succ*entity*eded his father, and that after his fathers deceasse the English Saxons, of whome there was a great number then in the Ile, comming ouer dailie like swarmes of b*entity*es, and hauing in possession not onelie Kent, but also the north parts of the realme towards Scotland, togither with a great part of the west countrie, thought it now a fit time to attempt the fortune of warre: and first therefore concluding a league with the Scots and Picts, vpon the sudden they turned their weapons points against the Britains, and most cruellie pursued them, as though they had receiued some great iniurie at their hands, and ne benefit at all. The Britains were maruelouslie abashed herewith, perceiuing that they should haue to doo with Hengist, a capteine of so high renowme, and also with their ancient enimies the Scots and Picts, thus all at one time, and that there was no remedie but either they must fight or else become slaues. Wherefore at length, dread of bondage stirred vp manhood in them, so that they assembled togither, and boldlie began to resist their enimies on ech side: but being too weake, they were easilie discomfited and put to flighty so that all 

<note place="marg">The Britains discomfited by the Scots.</note>

 hope of defense by force of armes being vtterlie taken awaie, as men in despaire to preuaile against their enimies, they fled as sh*entity*epe scattered abroad, some following one capteine and some another, getting them into desart places, woods and maresh grounds, and moreouer left such townes and fortresses as were of no notable strength, as a preie vnto their enimies.</p>
<p>Thus saith Polydor Virgil of the first breaking of the warres betwixt the Saxons and the Britains, which chanced not (as should appeare by that which he writeth thereof) till after the <pb n="560"/>death of Vortigerne. Howbeit he denieth not that Hengist at his first comming got seates for him and his people within the countie of Kent, and there began to inhabit. This ought 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sigebertus.</emph></note>

 not to be forgotten, that king Vortimer (as Sigebertus hath written) restored the christian religion after he had vanquished the Saxons, in such places where the same was decaied by the enimies inuasion, whose drift was not onelie to ouerrun the land with violence, but also to erect their owne laws and liberties without regard of clemencie.</p>

<p>AFTER all these bloudie broiles and tempestuous tumults ended, Vortigerne was restored and set againe into the kingdome of Britaine, in the yeare of our Lord 471. All the time of 

<note place="marg"><date>471.</date></note>

 his sonnes reigne, he had remained in the parties now called Wales, where (as some write) in that meane time he builded a strong castle called Generon, or Guaneren, in the west side of Wales nere to the riuer of Guana, vpon a mounteine called Cloaricus, which some referre to be builded in his second returne into Wales, as shall be shewed hereafter. And it is so much the more likelie, for that an old chronicle, which Fabian had sight of, affirmeth, that Vortigerne was kept vnder the rule of certeine gouernors to him appointed in the towne of Caerlegion, 

<note place="marg">Caerleon Arwiske.</note>

 and behaued himselfe in such commendable sort towards his sonne, in aiding him with his counsell, and otherwise in the meane season whilest his sonne reigned, that the Britains by reason thereof began so to fauour him, that after the death of Vortimer they made him king againe.</p>
<p>Shortlie after that Vortigerne was restored to the rule of the kingdom, Hengist aduertised 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith 4000. He might easilie returne, for except I be deceiued he was neuer driuen out after he had once set foot within this Ile.</note>

 therof returned into the land with a mightie armie of Saxons, whereof Vortigerne being admonished, assembled his Britains, and with all speed made towards him. When Hengist had knowledge of the huge host of the Britains that was comming against him, he required to come to a communication with Vortigerne, which request was granted, so that it was concluded, that on Maie day a certeine number of Britains, and as manie of the Saxons should meet togither vpon the plaine of Salisburie. Hengist hauing deuised a new kind of treason, when the day of their appointed m*entity*eting was come, caused euerie one of his allowed number secretlie to put into his hose a long knife (where it was ordeined that no man should bring anie weapon with him at all) and that at the verie instant when this watchword should be vttered 

<note place="marg">Nempt your sexes, what if it were messes.</note>

 by him, "Nempt your sexes," then should euerie of them plucke out his knife, and slea the Britaine that chanced to be next to him, except the same should be Vortigerne, whom he willed to be apprehended, but not slaine.</p>
<p>At the day assigned, the king with his appointed number or traine of the Britains, mistrusting nothing lesse than anie such maner of vnfaithfull dealing, came vnto the place in order before prescribed, without armor or weapon, where he found Hengist readie with his Saxons, the which receiued the king with amiable countenance and in most louing sort: but after they were a little entred into communication, Hengist meaning to accomplish his deuised purpose, 

<note place="marg">There died of the nobles of Britaine 460. as <emph>Gal.</emph> saith.</note>

 gaue the watchword, immediatlie wherevpon the Saxons drew out their kniues, and suddenlie fell on the Britains, and slue them as sh*entity*epe being fallen within the danger of woolues. For the Britains had no weapons to defend themselues, except anie of them by his strength and manhood got the knife of his enimie.</p>

<pb n="561"/>
<p>Amongst other of the Britains, there was one Edol earle of Glocester, or (as other say) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Cestren. Fabian.</emph></note>

 Chester, which got a stake out of an hedge, or else where, and with the same so defended himselfe and laid about him, that he slue 17 of the Saxons, and escaped to the towne of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal.</emph> saith 70. <emph>Math. West. Ran. Cestren.</emph></note>

 Ambrie, now called Salisburie, and so saued his owne life. Vortiger was taken and kept as prisoner by Hengist, till he was constreined to deliuer vnto Hengist thr*entity*e prouinces or countries of this realme, that is to say, Kent *entity* Essex, or as some write, that part where the south Saxons after did inhabit, as Sussex and other: the third was the countrie where the Estangles planted themselues, which was in Norfolke and Suffolke. Then Hengist being in possession of those thr*entity*e prouinces, suffered Vortigerne to depart, *entity* to be at his libertie.</p>
<p>*entity* William Malmesburie writeth somewhat otherwise of this taking of Vortigerne, during 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 whose reigne, after the deceasse of his sonne Vortimer, nothing was attempted against the Saxons, but in the meane time Hengist by colorable craft procured his sonne in law Vortigerne to come to a banket at his house, with three hundred other Britains, and when he had made them well and warme with often quaffing and emptieng of cups, and of purpose touched euerie of them with one bitter tawnt or other, they first fell to multiplieng of malicious words, and after to blowes that the Britains were slaine, euerie mothers sonne so y*entity*elding vp their ghosts euen amongst their pots. The king himselfe was taken, and to red*entity*eme himselfe out of prison, gaue to the Saxons thr*entity*e prouinces, and so escaped out of bondage.</p>
<p>Thus by what meane soeuer it came to passe, truth it is (as all writers agr*entity*e) that Hengist got possession of Kent, and of other countries in this realme, and began to reigne there as absolute lord *entity* gouernor, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord (as some write) 476, about the fift

<note place="marg">The decay of christian religion.</note>

 and to plant againe in all places their heathenish religion, and woorshipping of false gods: and not onelie hereby was the true faith of the Christians brought in danger dailie to decaie, but also the erronious opinions of the Pelagians greatlie preuailed here amongst the Britains, <pb n="562"/>by meanes of such vnsound preachers as in that troublesome season did set forth false doctrine amongst the people, without all maner of reprehension.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

<p>Certeine y*entity*eres before the comming of the Saxons, that heresie began to spread within this land verie much, by the lewd industrie of one Leporius Agricola, the sonne of Seuerus Sulpitius (as Bale saith) a bishop of that lore. But Pelagius the author of this heresie was borne in Wales, and held opinion that a man might obteine saluation by his owne fr*entity*e will and merit, and without assistance of grace, as he that was borne without originall sinne, *entity*c.</p>
<p>This erronious doctrine being taught therefore, and mainteined in this troublesome time of warres with the Saxons, sore disquieted the godlie minded men amongst the Britains, who not 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 meaning to receiue it, nor yet able well to confute the craftie and wicked persuasions vsed by the professors thereof, thought good to send ouer into Gallia, requiring of the bishops there, that some godlie and profound learned men might be sent ouer from thence into this land, to defend the cause of the true doctrine against the naughtie teachers of so blasphemous an error. Whervpon the bishops of Gallia sore lamenting the miserable state of the Britains, and desirous to relieue their present n*entity*ed, speciallie in that case of religion, called a synod, and 

<note place="marg">A synod called in Gallia.</note>

 therein taking counsell to consider who were most m*entity*et to be sent, it was decr*entity*ed by all their 

<note place="marg">Germanus and Lupus.</note>

 consents in the end, that one Germane the bishop of Auxerre, and Lupus bishop of Trois should passe ouer into Britaine to confirme the Christians there in the faith of the celestiall grace. And so those two vertuous learned men taking their iournie, finallie arriued in Britaine, though not without some danger by sea, through stormes *entity* rage of winds, stirred (as hath beene thought of the superstitious) by the malice of wicked spirits, who purposed to haue hindered their proc*entity*edings in this their good and well purposed iournie. After they were come ouer, they did so much good with conuincing the wicked arguments of the aduersaries of the truth, by the inuincible power of the woord of God, and holinesse of life, that those which were in the wrong waie, were soone brought into the right path againe.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph> Palladius.</note>

<p>About the same time also, one Palladius was sent from Celestinus bishop of Rome, vnto the Scots, to instruct them in the faith of Christ, and to purge them from the heresie of the said 

<note place="marg">Constantine king of Scots.</note>

 Pelagius. This Palladius exhorted Constantinus the king of Scots, that in no wise he should aid the Saxons being infidels against the Britains: whose exhortation tooke so good effect, that the said Constantinus did not onelie forbeare to assist the Saxons, but contrarilie holpe the Britains in their warres against them, which thing did mainteine the state of the Britains for a time from falling into vtter ruine and decaie. In the meane time, the Saxons renewed 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt. Beda.</emph></note>

 their league with the Picts, so that their powers being ioined togither, they began afresh to make sore warres vpon the Britains, who of necessitie were constreined to assemble an armie, *entity* mistrusting their owne strength, required aid of the two bishops, Germane and Lupus, who hasting forward with all speed came into the armie, bringing with them no small hope of good lucke to all the Britains there being assembled. This was doone in Kent.</p>
<p>Now such was the diligence of the bishops, that the people (being instructed with continuall preaching) in renouncing the error of the Pelagians, earnestlie came by troops to receiue the grace of God offred in baptisme, so that on Easter day which then insued, the more part of 

<note place="marg">The armie of the Britains ne slie christened.</note>

 the armie was baptised, and so went foorth against the enimies, who hearing thereof, made hast towards the Britains, in hope to ouercome them at pleasure. But their approch being knowne, bishop Germane tooke vpon him the leading of the British host, and ouer against the passage thorough the which the enimies were appointed to come, he chose foorth a faire vallie inclosed with high mounteins, and within the same he placed his new washed armie. And when he saw the enimies now at hand, he commanded that euerie man with one generall voice should answer him, crieng alowd the same crie that he should begin. So that euen as the enimies were readie to giue the charge vpon the Britains, supposing that they should haue taken them at vnwares, and before anie warning had b*entity*en giuen, suddenlie bishop Germane 

<note place="marg">Alleluia.</note>

 and the priests with a lowd and shrill voice called <emph>Alleluia,</emph> thrice: and therewith all the multitudes of the Britains with one voice cried the same crie, with such a lowd shout, that the Saxons were therewith so amazed and astonied (the echo from the rocks and hils adioining, <pb n="563"/>redoubling in such wise the crie) that they thought not onelie the rocks and clifs had fallen vpon them, but that euen the skie it selfe had broken in p*entity*eces and come tumbling downe vpon their heads: h*entity*erewith therefore throwing awaie their weapons, they tooke them to their f*entity*et, and glad was he that might get to be formost in running awaie. Manie of them for hast were drowned in a riuer which they had to passe. Polydor taketh that riuer to be Trent. The Britains hauing thus vanquished their enimies, gathered the spoile at good leasure, *entity* gaue God thanks for the victorie thus got without bloud, for the which the holie bishops also triumphed as best became them. Now after they had setled all things in good quiet within the Ile, as was thought expedient, they returned into Gallia or France, from whence they came (as is before rehearsed.)</p>

 about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 448, a little before the comming of the Saxons into this land vnder 

<note place="marg"><date>448.</date></note>

 Hengist, in which y*entity*ere Germane first came hither to w*entity*ed out the heresie of Pelagius, as by the same author more at large is affirmed. Howbeit, some chronographers alledge out of Prosper *entity* other, and note the first comming of Germane to haue b*entity*ene in the 429 y*entity*ere of Christ, and vnder the consulship of Florentius and Dionysius. And this should s*entity*eme to agr*entity*e with the truth, for that after some, the foresaid Germane should die at Rauenna, about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 450, as Vincentius noteth, which was the verie yeere of the comming of the Saxons: notwithstanding, when or wheresoeuer he died, it was not long after his returne into Gallia, vpon his first iournie made hither into this land, who no sooner obteined the victorie before mentioned, but woord was brought againe vnto him, that eftsoones the heresie of the Pelagians was spread abroad in Britaine, and therefore all the priests or cleargie made request to him that it might stand with his pleasure to come ouer againe, and defend the cause of true religion which he had before confirmed.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon bishop Germane granted so to doo, and therefore taking with him one Seuerus 

<note place="marg">Germane returneth againe into Britaine.</note>

 (that was disciple vnto Lupus, and ordeined at that time bishop of Triers) tooke the sea, and came againe into Britaine, where he found the multitude of the people stedfast in the same beliefe wherein he had left them, *entity* perceiued the fault to rest in a few: wherevpon inquiring out the authors, he condemned them to exile (as it is written) and with a manifest miracle by restoring a yoong man that was lame (as they saie) vnto the right vse of his lims, he confirmed his doctrine. Then followed preaching to persuade amendment of errors, and by the generall consent of all men, the authors of the wicked doctrine being banished the land, were deliuered vnto bishop Germane and to his fellow Seuerus, to conueie them away in their companie vnto the parties beyond the seas, that the region might so be deliuered of further danger, and they receiue the benefit of due amendment.</p>
<p>By this meanes it came to passe, that the true faith continued in Britaine sound and perfect a long time after. Things being thus set in good order, those holie men returned into their countries, the forenamed bishop Germane went to Rauenna to sue for peace to be granted vnto the people of Britaine Armorike, where being receiued of the emperor Valentinian and his mother Placida in most reuerend maner, he departed in that citie out of this transitorie life, to the eternall ioies of heauen. His bodie was afterwards conueied to the

<p>*entity* By this it maie app*entity*ere, that bishop Germane came into this realme both the first and second time, whilest as well Hengist, as also Vortigerne were liuing: for the said Valentinian

<note place="marg"><emph>Galfrid.</emph></note>

 with other cities *entity* townes, he not onelie fearing their puissance, but also the returne of Aurelius Ambrosius, and his brother Vter Pendragon, withdrew him into Wales, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Caxton. Fabian. Polychron.</emph></note>

 where he began to build a strong castell vpon a mounteine called Breigh, or after other Cloaric, n*entity*ere to the riuer of Guana, which is in the west side of Wales in a place within the 

<note place="marg">Mount Erix he calleth it in one place of his booke.</note>

 compasse of the same hill called Generon or Gueineren. Of the building of this castell, and of the hinderance in erecting the same, with the monstrous birth of Merlin and his knowledge in prophesieng, the British histories tell a long processe, the which in Caxton, and in Galfrides bookes is also set foorth, as there ye maie s*entity*e: but for that the same s*entity*emeth not of such credit as deserueth to be registred in anie sound historie, we haue with silence passed it ouer.</p>

<note place="marg">Aurelius and Vter brethren returne into Britaine.</note>

<p>Whilest Vortigerne was busied in building of this castell, the two foresaid brethren Aurelius and Vter prepared a nauie of ships, and an armie of men, by helpe of such their kinsmen and fr*entity*ends as they found in Britaine Armorike, and so passed the sea, and landed at Totnesse: whereof when the Britains were aduertised, the which were scattered abroad and seuered in diuers parties and countries, they drew vnto the said two brethren with all sp*entity*ed that might be. When Aurelius and his brother Vter perceiued that they were sufficientlie furnished of people, they marched foorth towards Wales against Vortigerne, who hauing knowledge of their 

<note place="marg">Vortigerne burnt to death. Wild fire not yet inuented as some think.</note>

 approch, had fortified his castell verie strongly with men, munition and vittels, but yet all auailed him nothing, for in the end after his enimies had giuen diuers assaults to the said castell, they found meanes with wild fire to burne it downe to the earth, and so consumed it by fire togither with the king, and all other that were within it.</p>
<p>Thus did Vortigerne end his life (as in the British historie is recorded.) Much euill is reported of him by the same historie, and also by other writers, and among other things it is written, that he should lie by his owne daughter, and of hir beget a sonne, in hope that kings 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychron.</emph> A feined tale of S. Germane.</note>

 should come of him, and therefore he was excommunicated by S. Germane. It is also said, that when the same S. Germane came into Britaine (as before ye haue heard) this Vortigerne on a time should denie the same S. Germane harbour: but one that kept the kings heards of 

<note place="marg">A caluish narration.</note>

 cattell receiued him into his house, and lodged him, and slue a calfe for his supper, which calfe after supper was ended, S. Germane restored againe to life: and on the morrow by the ordinance of God, he caused Vortigerne to be deposed from his kinglie estate, and tooke the heardman and made him king. But Ranulfe Hig. in his "Polychronicon," alledging Gyldas for his author, saith that this chanced to a king that ruled in Powsey, whose name was Bulie, and not to Vortigerne: so that the successors of that Bulie reigning in that side of Wales, came of the linage of the same heardman.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

<p>Moreouer it hath beene said (as one writer recordeth) that when Vortigerne refused to heare the preaching of saint Germane, and fled from him as he would haue instructed him, one night there fell fire from heauen vpon the castell wherein the king was lodged, and so the king being destroied with the fall of the house and the fire togither, was neuer after s*entity*ene. *entity* But these are fables, and therfore I passe them ouer, hoping that it shall suffice to shew here with what stuffe our old historiographers haue farced vp their huge volumes, not so much <pb n="565"/>regarding the credit of an historie, as satisfieng the vanitie of their owne fond fantasies, studieng with a pretended skilfulnesse to cast glorious colours vpon lies, that the readers (whom they presupposed either ignorant or credulous) would be led away with a flowing streme of woords void of reason and common sense.

 riuer of Humber, incountred with the Saxons at a place called Maesbell, and ouerthrew them in a strong battell, from the which as Hengist was fl*entity*eing to haue saued himselfe, he was 

<note place="marg">Hengist taken and beheaded.</note>

 taken by Edoll earle of Glocester, or (as some say) Chester, and by him led to Conningsborrow, where he was beheaded by the counsell of Eldad then bishop of Colchester.</p>
<p>Howbeit there be some that write, how that Hengist was taken at another battell fought 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 vpon the riuer of Dune, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 489, and not in the chase of the battell which was fought at Maesbell in the y*entity*ere 487, as the same authors doo alledge. Occa the 

<note place="marg">Occa.</note>

 son of Hengist by flight escaped to Yorke, and being there besieged, at length was constreined to y*entity*eld himselfe to Aurelius: who dealing fauourablie with him, assigned vnto him and other of the Saxons a countrie bordering neere to the Scots, which (as some affirme) was Galloway, where the said Occa and the Saxons began to inhabit. Then did Aurelius Ambrosius put the Saxons out of all other parts of the land, *entity* repaired such cities, townes and also churches, as by them had beene destroied or defaced, and placed againe priests, and such other as should attend on the ministerie and seruice of God in the same churches.</p>
<p>Also for a perpetuall memorie of those Britains that were slaine on the plaine of Salisburie by the treason of Hengist, he caused stones to be fetched out of Ireland, and to be set vp in the same place where that slaughter was committed, and called the place Stoneheng, which 

<note place="marg">Stoneheng.</note>

 name continueth vnto this day. Fift*entity*ene thousand men (as Galfrid saith) were sent for those 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 stones, vnder the leading of Vter Pendragon the kings brother, who giuing battell vnto Gillomanus king of Ireland that went about to resist the Britains, and would not permit them to fetch away the same stones out of his countrie, discomfited him and his people, and so (maugre his hart) brought the stones away with him.</p>

<pb n="566"/>
<p>Shortlie after, Pascentius that was Vortigerns yoongest sonne, and had escaped into Ireland (when Aurelius Ambrosius came into Britaine) returned with a great power of strange nations, and tooke the citie of Meneuia in Wales, afterwards called saint Dauids, and did much hurt in the countrie with fire and swoord. At which time the same Aurelius Ambrosius lay sicke at Winchester, and being not able to go foorth himselfe, desired his brother Vter Pendragon to assemble an armie of Britains, and to go against Pascentius and his adherents. Vter, according to his brothers request, gathering his people, went foorth, and incountering with the enimies gaue them the ouerthrow, slue Pascentius and Gillomare or Gilloman king of Ireland, that was come ouer with him in aid against the Britains.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

<p>In the meane while, a Saxon or some other stranger, whose name was Eopa or Copa, not long before procured thereto by Pascentius, fained himselfe to be a Britaine, and for a colour counterfeiting himselfe a moonke, and to haue great knowledge in physicke, was admitted to 

<note place="marg"><emph>Falian.</emph></note>

 minister as it were medicins to Aurelius: but in stead of that which should haue brought him health, he gaue him poison, whreof he died shortlie after at Winchester aforesaid, when he had reigned after most accord of writers nint*entity*ene yeeres: his bodie was conueied to Stoneheng and there buried. *entity* Thus find we in the British and common English histories of the dooings of Aurelius Ambrosius, who (as ye haue hard) makes him a Britaine borne, and descended of the bloud of the ancient Britains, But Gyldas and Beda report him to be a Romane by descent, as before is mentioned.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

<p>Polydor Virgil writeth in this sort of the victorious acts atchiued by the foresaid Aurelius Ambrosius. Then (saith he) the Saxons hauing alreadie gotten the whole rule of the lie, practised their outragious cruelties speciallie against the princes of the Britains, to the end that the said princes being ouercome and destroied, they might with more ease obteine possession of the whole Ile, which thing they onlie sought. But the fauour of almightie God was not wanting to the miserable Britains in that great necessitie. For behold, Aurelius Ambrosius was at hand, who had no sooner caused the trumpet to sound to armor, but euerie man for himselfe prepared and repaired vnto him, praieng *entity* beseeching him to helpe to defend them, and that it might stand with his pleasure to go foorth with them against the enimies in all speed.</p>
<p>Thus an armie being assembled, Aurelius Ambrosius went against them, and valiantlie assailed them, so that within the space of a few daies they fought thr*entity*e battels with great fiercenesse on both sides, in triall of their high displeasures and vttermost forces, in which at length the Britains put the Saxons to flight, Horsus the brother of Hengist being slaine with a great number of his people. But yet notwithstanding the enimies rage was little abated hereby, for within a few daies after receiuing out of Germanie a new supplie of men, they brake foorth vpon the Britains with great confidence of victorie. Aurelius Ambrosius was no sooner aduertised thereof, but that without delaie he set forward towards Yorke, from whence the enimies should come, and hearing by the way that Hengist was incamped about seuen *entity* twentie miles distant from that citie, n*entity*ere to the banke of a riuer at this day called Dune, in the place where Doncaster now standeth, he returned out of his waie, and marched towards that place, and the next day set on the enimie and vanquished him, Hengist at the first 

<note place="marg">Hengist is laine.</note>

 m*entity*eting of the battell being slaine, with a great number of the Germans. The fame of this victorie (saith Polydor) is had in memorie with the inhabitants of those parties euen vnto this day, which victorie did sore diminish the power of the Saxons, insomuch that they began now to thinke it should be more for their profit to sit in rest with that dishonour, than to make anie new warres to their great disaduantage and likelihood of present losse.</p>
<p>Hengist left behind him two sonnes, Osca and Occa, which as men most sorowfull for the ouerthrow of late receiued, assembled such power as they could togither, and remooued therewith towards the west part of the Ile, supposing it to be better for them to draw that way foorth, than to returne into Kent, where they thought was alreadie a sufficient number of their people to resist the Britains on that side. Now therefore when they came into the west parts of the land, they wasted the countrie, burnt villages, and absteined from no maner of <pb n="567"/>crueltie that might be shewed. These things being reported vnto Aurelius Ambrosius, he straightwaies hasted thither to resist those enimies, and so giuing them battell, eftsoones discomfited them: but he himselfe receiuing a wound, died thereof within a few daies after. 

<note place="marg">Aurelius dieth of a wound.</note>

 The English Saxons hauing thus susteined so manie losses within a few moneths togither, were contented to be quiet now that the Britains stirred nothing against them, by reason they were 

<note place="marg">Vortimer departeth this life.</note>

 brought into some trouble by the death of such a noble capteine as they had now lost. In the meane time Vortimer died, whome Vter surnamed Pendragon succ*entity*eded.</p>
<p>Thus hath Polydor written of the forsaid Aurelius Ambrosius, not naming him to be king of Britaine, and differing in d*entity*ed in sundrie points in this behalfe from diuerse ancient writers of the English histories: for where he attributeth the victorie to the Britains in the battell fought, wherein Horsus the brother of Hengist was slaine, by the report of Polychronicon, and others, the Saxons had the victorie in that reincounter: and William of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 Malmesburie saith, that they departed from that batell with equall fortune, the Saxons losing their capteine Horsus, and the Britains their capteine Katigerne (as before ye haue heard.) 

<note place="marg">Katigerne.</note>

 But there is such contrarietie in writers touching the dooings betwixt the Britains and Saxons in those daies, as well in account of y*entity*eres, as in report of things doone, that setting affection aside, hard it is to iudge to which part a man should giue credit.</p>
<p>For Fabian and other authors write, that Aurelius Ambrosius began his reigne ouer the Britains about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 481, and Horsus was slaine about the y*entity*ere 458, 

<note place="marg">458.</note>

 during the reigne of Vortimer, as aboue is mentioned, so that it cannot stand with the truth of the British histories (the which Fabian followeth) that Horsus was slaine by Aurelius Ambrosius, if according to the same histories he returned not into Britaine, till the time there supposed. But diuerse such maner of contrarieties shall ye find, in perusing of those writers that haue written the chronicles of the Britains and Saxons, the which in euerie point to recite, would be too tedious and combersome a matter, and therefore we are forced to passe the same ouer, not knowing how to bring them to anie iust accord for the satisfieng of all mens minds, speciallie the curious, which may with diligent search satisfie themselues happilie much better, than anie other shall be able to doo in vttering his opinion neuer so much at large, and agr*entity*eable to a truth. This therefore haue we thought good as it were by the waie to touch what diuerse authors doo write, leauing it so to euerie mans iudgement to construe thereof, as his affection leadeth him. We find in the writings of those that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Sigebertus.</emph></note>

 haue registred the dooings of these times, that Aurelius hauing vanquished the Saxons, restored churches to the furtherance of the christian religion, which by the inuasion of the Saxons 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith 488.</note>

 was greatlie decaied in diuerse parts of Britaine, and this chanced in the daies of the emperour Theodosius the yoonger.</p>

 named the kingdome of the Southsaxons, which had for limits on the east side Kent, on the south the sea and Iie of Wight, on the west Hamshire, and on the north part Southerie. This kingdome (after some) began vnder the foresaid Ella, about the 32 yeere after the first comming of the Saxons into this land, which by following that account, should be about 

<note place="marg"><date>452.</date></note>

 the second y*entity*ere of the reigne of Aurelius Ambrosius, and about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 482. But other write, that it did begin about the 30 y*entity*ere after the first comming of Hengist, which should be two y*entity*eres sooner.</p>
<p>William Harison differing from all other, noteth it to begin in the fourth y*entity*ere after the death of Hengist, 4458 of the world, 2 of the 317 Olympiad, 1248 of Rome, 492 of Christ, and 43 after the comming of the Saxons: his woords are these. Ella erected the kingdome or the Southsaxons, in the 15 after his arriuall, and reigned 32 y*entity*eres, the chiefe citie of his kingdome also was Chichester, and after he had inioied the same his kingdome a while, he ouerthrew the citie called Andredescester, which as then was taken for one of the most famous in all the south side of England. *entity* For my part I thinke my dutie discharged, if I shew the opinions of the writers: for if I should therto ad mine owne, I should but increase coniectures, whereof alreadie we haue superfluous store. To proc*entity*ed thereforr as I find.</p>
<p>About the ninth y*entity*ere after the comming of Ella, the Britains perceiuing that he with his Saxons still inlarged the bounds of his lordship by entring further into the land, assembled themselues togither vnder their kings and rulers, and gaue battell to Ella and his sonnes at Mecredesbourne, where they departed with doubtfull victorie, the armies on both sides being sore diminished, and so returned to their homes. Ella after this battell sent into his countrie for more aid.</p>
<p>But now touching Hengist, who as ye haue heard, reigned as king in the prouince of Kent, the writers of the English kings varie somewhat from the British histories, both in report of the battels by him fought against the Britains, and also for the maner of his death: as thus. After that Vortimer was dead, who departed this life (as some write) in the first y*entity*ere of the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychron.</emph></note>

 emperor Leo, surnamed the great, and first of that name that gouerned the empire, who began 

<note place="marg">457.</note>

 to rule in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 457, we find that Hengist and his sonne Occa or Osca 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henrie Hunt. Wil. Malm.</emph> Creiford. Britains ouerthrowne.</note>

 gathered their people togither that were before sparkled, and hauing also receiued new aid out of Germanie, fought with the Britains at a place called Crekenford, where were slaine of the Britains foure dukes or capteins, and foure thousand of other men, the residue were chased by Hengist out of Kent vnto London, so that they neuer returned afterwards againe into Kent: thus the kingdome of Kent began vnder Hengist the twelfe y*entity*ere after the comming of the Saxons into Britaine, and Hengist reigned in Kent after this (as the same writers agree) foure and twentie y*entity*eres.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychron.</emph></note>

<p>It is remembred that those Germans which latelie were come ouer to the aid of Hengist, being chosen men, mightie and strong of bodie, with their axes and swoords made great slaughter of the Britains in that battell at Crekenford or Creiford, which Britains were ranged 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 in foure battels vnder their aforesaid foure dukes or capteins, and were (as before is mentioned) slaine in the same battell. About the sixt y*entity*ere of the said emperor Leo, which was

<p>This victorie was nothing plesant to the Saxons, by reason of the great losse which they susteined, as well by the death of the said Wipet, as of a great number of others: and so of a long time neither did the Saxons enter into the confines of the Britains, nor the Britains presumed to come into Kent. But whitest outward wars ceassed among the Britains, they exercised ciuill battell, falling togither by the eares among themselues, one striuing against another. Finallie, Hengist departed this life by course of nature, in the 39 y*entity*ere after 

<note place="marg">Fortie y*entity*eres saith <emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 his first comming into Britaine, hauing proc*entity*eded in his businesse no lesse with craft and <pb n="569"/>guile than with force and strength, following therewith his natiue crueltie, so that he rather

<p>About thr*entity*e y*entity*eres after the deceasse of Hengist, a new supplie of men of warre came out of Germanie vnto the aid of Ella king of Sussex, who hauing his power increased, besieged the citie of Andredescester, which was verie strong and well furnished with men and all things necessarie. The Britains also assembling togither in companies, greatlie annoied the Saxons as they lay here at siege, laieng ambushes to destroie such as went abroad, and ceassing not to glue alarums to the campe in the night season: and the Saxons could no sooner prepare them selues to giue the assalt, but the Britains were readie to assaile them on the backs, till at length the Saxons diuiding themselues into two companies, appointed the one to giue the assalt, and the other to incounter with the armie of the Britains without, and so finallie by that meanes preuailed, tooke the citie, and destroied man, woman and child. Neither so contented, they did also vtterlie race the said citie, so as it was neuer after that daie builded or reedified againe.</p>

 Lord 561, the kingdome of the east Angles began vnder a Saxon named Uffa. This same kingdome conteined Northfolke and Suffolke, hauing on the east and north parts the sea, on the northwest Cambridgeshire, and on the west saint Edmunds ditch with a part of

 Hertfordshire, and on the southside lieth Essex. At the first it was called Vffines dominion, and the kings that reigned, or the people that inhabited there, were at the first named Vffines, but at length they were called east Angles.</p>

<p>*entity* Thus ye maie s*entity*e, that Aurelius Ambrosius did succ*entity*ed Vortigerne, and reigned in the time supposed by the British histories, as before is alledged, the land euen in his daies was full of trouble, and the old inhabitants the Britains sore vexed by the Saxons that entred the same, so that the Britains were dailie hampered, and brought vnder subiection to the valiant Saxons, or else driuen to remooue further off, and to giue place to the victors. But now to proc*entity*ed with the succession of the British kings, as in their histories we find them registred, which I deliuer such as I find, but not such as I doo wish, being written with no such colour of credit as we maie safelie put foorth the same for an vndoubted truth.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> noteth.</note>

<p>After that Aurelius Ambrosius was dead, his brother Vter Pendragon (whome some call 

<note place="marg"><date>500.</date></note>

 Aurelius Vterius Ambrosianus) was made king in the yeare of our Lord 500, in the seuenth yeare of the emperour Anastasius, and in the sixt*entity*enth yeare of Clodoueus king of the Frenchmen. The cause why he was surnamed Pendragon, was, for that Merline the great prophet likened him to a dragons head, that at the time of his natiuitie maruelouslie appeared in the firmament at the corner of a blasing star, as is reported. But others supposed he was so called of his wisedome and serpentine subtiltie, or for that he gaue the dragons head in his banner. This Vter, hearing that the Saxons with their capteins Occa or Otta the sonne of Hengist, and his brother Osca had besieged the citie of Yorke, hasted thither, and giuing them battell, discomfited their power, and tooke the said Occa and Osca prisoners.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

<p>From this varieth Hector Boetius in his chronicle of Scotland, writing of these dooings in Britaine: for he affirmeth, that the counterfeit moonke, which poisoned Aurelius Ambrosius, was suborned and sent to woorke that feat by Occa, and not by his brother Pascentius: and further, that about the selfesame time of Aurelius his death, his brother Vter Pendragon lay in Wales, not as yet fullierecouered of a sore sicknesse, wherewith of late hehad b*entity*ene much vexed. Yet the lords of Britaine after the buriall of Aurelius Ambrosius, came vnto him and crowned him king: and though he was not able to go against the Saxons (which as then by reason of Aurelius Ambrosius his death were verie busie, and more earnest in pursuing the warre than before) yet an armie was prepared and sent foorth with all conuenient sp*entity*ed vnder the leading of one Nathaliod, a man neither of anie great ancient house, nor yet of skill in warlike affaires.</p>
<p>The noble men were nothing pleased herewith, as misliking altogither the lacke of discretion in their new king, *entity* doubted sore, least in time to come he would haue more delight to aduance the men of base degr*entity*e, than such as were descended of noble parentage. Yet because they would not put the state of the common wealth in danger through anie mutinie, they agr*entity*ed to go foorth with him in that iournie. Occa had aduertisement giuen him by certeine letters sent to him from some close friends amongest the Britains of the whole matter: and therefore in hope of the better sp*entity*ed, he hasted foorth to incounter the Britains, and so the whole armie comming within sight of the other, they prepared to the battell, and shortlie after buckling togither, the Britains were soone discomfited, by reason that one of their chiefest capteins called Gothlois disdaining to be at the appointment of Nathaliod, got him vp to the next hill with the next battell which he led, leauing the other Britains in all the danger: which they s*entity*eing began by *entity* by to fl*entity*e. There died no great number of the Britains, except those that were killed in the fight: for Occa mistrusting what Gothlois meant by his withdrawing aside, would not suffer the Saxons to follow the chase, but in the night following Gothlois got him awaie, and rested not till he was out of danger. Occa then perceiuing himselfe to haue the vpper hand, sent an herald vnto king Vter with a certeine message, threatning destruction to him and to his people, if he refused to doo that which he should appoint.</p>
<p>Vter perceiuing what disloialtie rested in the harts of his owne subiects, agr*entity*ed that the matter might be committed to eight graue and wise councellors, foure Britains and foure Saxons, which might haue full power to make an end of all controuersies and variances depending betwixt the two nations. Occa was likewise contented therewith, wherevpon were named on either part foure persons, of such wisedome, knowledge and experience, as were thought meetest for the ordering of such a weightie matter. So that by the arbitrement, award and <pb n="571"/>doome of those eight persons authorised thereto, a league was concluded vpon certeine articles of agreement, amongst the which the chiefest was, that the Saxons from thencefoorth should quietlie inioy all that part of Britaine which lieth fore against the Almaine seas, the same to be called euer after Engistlaund, and all the residue should remaine to the Britains as their owne rightfull and ancient inheritance. Thus far Hector Boetius.</p>
<p>But now to returne vnto Vter according to that we find in the British histories, and to proc*entity*ed after our owne historians; we find, that when he had vanquished the Saxons and taken their two chiefeteins prisoners, in processe of time he fell in loue with a verie beautifull ladie called Igwarne or Igerna, wife to one Gorolus or Gorlois duke of Cornewall, the which duke 

<note place="marg">Gorolus duke of Cornewall.</note>

 he slue at length n*entity*ere to his owne castell called Diuulioc in Cornewall, to the end that he might inioy the said ladie, whome he afterwards maried, and begot on hir that noble knight Arthur, and a daughter named Amie or Anna. Occa and Osca escaping also out of prison assembled eftsoones a power of Saxons, and made warre against the Britains, whereof Vter hauing aduertisement prepared to resist them, and finallie went himselfe in person against them, and at saint Albans (as some write) gaue them battell, and slue them both in 

<note place="marg"><emph>Herding.</emph></note>

 the field.</p>
<p>By that which Polydor Virgil writeth, it should s*entity*eme that Germane the bishop of Auxerre came into Britaine in the daies of this Vter, by whose presence the Britains had victorie against the Saxons (as before ye haue heard) after which victorie both rested from troubling either other for a time. The Saxons as it were astonied with that present miracle, *entity* the Britains not following their good successe, shortlie after fell at discord amongst themselues, which finallie brought them to vtter decaie, as after shall appeare. But the Saxons desirous to spoile the Britains of the whole possession of that part of the Ile which they held, whereas they accounted the cities and townes of small strength to be defended, they got them to an high mounteine 

<note place="marg">Badon hill</note>

 called Badon hill, which Polydor supposeth to be Blackamore that lieth n*entity*ere to the water of Theise, which diuideth the bishoprike of Durham from Yorkeshire, hauing at the mouth thereof an hauen m*entity*et to receiue such ships as come out of Germanie, from whence the Saxons looked for aid, hauing alreadie sent thither for the same.</p>
<p>The Britains being thereof aduertised, made hast towards the place, and besieged it on euerie side. They also laie the sea coasts full of souldiers, to k*entity*epe such of the enimies from landing as should come out of Germanie. The Saxons kept themselues for a certeine space aloft vpon the high ground, but in the end constreined through want of vittels, they came downe with their armie in order of battell to the next plaines, and offering to fight, the battell was anon begun, which continued from the morning till far in the day, with such slaughter, that the earth on euerie side flowed with bloud: but the Saxons susteined the greater losse, their capteins Occa and Osca being both slaine, so that the Britains might s*entity*eme quite deliuered of all danger of those enimies: but the fatall destinie could not be auoided, as hereafter may appeare. And thus was the slaughter made of the Saxons at Badon hill, whereof Gyldas maketh mention, and chanced the same yeare that he was borne, which was in the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gyldas.</emph></note>

 44 yeare after the first comming of the Saxons into this land, the yeare of Grace 492, *entity* 15 

<note place="marg"><date>492.</date></note>

 indiction.</p>
<p>About the same time Vter departed out of this life (saith Polydor) so that this account 

<note place="marg">The decease of Vetr Pendragon.</note>

 agr*entity*eth nothing with the common account of those authors, whome Fabian and other haue followed. For either we must presuppose, that Vter reigned before the tine appointed to him by the said authors, either else that the siege of Badon hill was before he began to reigne, as it should s*entity*eme in d*entity*ed by that which Wil. Malmesburie writeth thereof, as hereafter shall be also shewed. Finallie (according to the agr*entity*ement of the English writers) Vter Pendragon died by poison, when he had gouerned this land by the full terme of 16 years, *entity* was after buried by his brother Aurelius at Stoneheng, otherwise called <emph>Chorea Gigantum,</emph> 

<note place="marg">Stoncheng, Chorea Oigantum.</note>

 leauing his sonne Arthur to succ*entity*ed him. *entity* Here ye must note that the Scotish chronicles declare, that in all the warres for the more part wherein the Britains obteined victorie against <pb n="572"/>the Saxons, the Scots aided them in the same warres, and so likewise did the Picls, but the same chronicles dos not onelie varie from the British writers in account or yeares, but also in the order of things doone, as in the same chronicles more plainelie may appeare, *entity* namelie in the discourse of the accidents which chanced during the reigne of this Vter. For whereas the British histories, as ye haue heard, attribtute great praise vnto the same Vter for his victories atchiued against the Saxons and their king Occa, whome he slue in battell, and obteined a great victorie, the Scotish writers make other report, affirming in deed that by the presence of bishop Germane he obteined victorie in one battell against them: but shortlie after the Britains fought againe with the Saxons, and were discomfited, although Occa in following the chase ouer rashlie chanced to be slaine: after whose deceasse the Saxons ordeined his sonne named also Occa to succ*entity*ed in his place, who to make himselfe strong against all his enimies, sent into Germanie for one Colgerne, the which with a great power of Dutchmen came ouer into this our Britaine, and conquered by Occas appointment the countrie of Northumberland, situate betw*entity*ene Tine and Tweed, as in the Scotish chronicles may further appeare.</p>
<p>Also this is to be remembred, that the victorie which was got against the Saxons by the Britains, at what time Germane bishop of Auxerre was present: Hector Boetius affirmeth (by authoritie of Veremond that wrote the Scotish chronicles) to haue chanced the second time of his comming ouer into this land, where Beda auoucheth it to be at his first being heere. Againe the same Boetius writeth, that the same victorie chanced in the daies of Vter Pendragon. Which can not be, if it be true that Beda writeth, touching the time of the death of the said Germane: for where he departed this life before the yeare of our Lord 459, as aboue is said, Vter Pendragon began not his reigne till the yeare of our Lord 500 or as the same Hector Boetius saith 503, so that bishop Germane was dead long before that Vter began to reigne.</p>
<p>In d*entity*ed some writers haue noted, that the third battell which Vortimer fought against the Saxons, was the same wherein S. Germane was present, and procured the victorie with the crie of <emph>Alleluia,</emph> as before ye haue heard. Which seemeth to be more agr*entity*eable to truth, and to stand also with that which holie Beda hath written, touching the time of the being h*entity*ere of the said Germane, than the opinion of other, which affirme that it was in the time of the reigne of Vter. The like is to be found in the residue of Hector Boetius his booke, touching the time speciallie of the reignes of the British kings that gouerned Britaine about that season. For as he affirmeth, Aurelius Ambrosius began his reigne in the yeare of our Lord 498, and ruled but seuen yeares, and then succ*entity*eded Vter, which reigned 18 yeares, and departed this life in the yeare of our Lord 521.</p>
<p>*entity* Notwithstanding the premisses, here is to be remembred, that whatsoeuer the British writers haue recorded touching the victories of this Vter had against the Saxons, and how that Osca the sonne of Hengist should be slaine in battell by him and his power: in 

<note place="marg">Osca. 34 Saith <emph>Henrie Hunt.</emph> in corrupted copies.</note>

 those old writers which haue registred the acts of the English Saxon kings we find no such matter, but rather that after the deceasse of Hengist, his sonne Osca or Occa reigned in Kent 24 yeares, defending his kingdome onelie, and not s*entity*eking to inlarge it (as before is touched.) After whose death his sonne Oth, and Irmenrike sonne to the same Oth succ*entity*eded, more resembling their father than, their grandfather or great grandfather. To their reignes are assigned fiftie and three yeares by the chronicles: but whethe they reigned iointlie togither, or seuerallie *entity* apart either after other, it is not certeinlie perceiued.</p>

 reigne of Vter Pendragon. We find that one Porth a Saxon with his two sons Megla and Beda came on land at Portesmouth in Sussex, about the beginning of the said Vters reigne, and slue a noble yoong man of the Britains, and manic other of the meaner sort with him. Of this Porth the towne *entity* hauen of Portesmouth tooke the name, as some haue thought. Moreouer, about 40 yeares after the comming of the Saxons into this land with their leader Hengist, one Nazaleod, a mightie king amongst the Britains, assembled all the power he could make to fight with Certicus king of the Westsaxons, who vnderstanding of the great power of his enimies, required aid of Osca king of Kent, also of Elle king of Sussex, and of Porth and his sonnes which were latelie before arriued as ye haue heard. Certicus being then furnished with a conuenient armie, diuided the same into two battels, reseruing the one to himselfe, and the other he appointed to his sonne Kenrike. King Nazaleod perceiuing that the wing which Certicus led, was of more strength than the other which Kenrike gouerned, he set first vpon Certicus, thinking that if he might distresse that part of the enimies armie, he should easilie ouercome the other. Herevpon he gaue such a fierce charge vpon that wing, that by verie force he opened the same, and so ouerthrew the Saxons on that side, making great slaughter of them as they were scattered. Which maner of dealing when Kenrike saw, he made forward with all sp*entity*ed to succour his father, and rushing in amongst

 the Britains on their backs, he brake their armie in p*entity*eces, and slue their king Nazaleod, and withall put his people to flight. There died of the Britains that daie 5000 men, and the residue escaped by fl*entity*eing as well as they might. In the sixt yeare after this battell, Stuff and Wightgar that were nephues to Certicus, came with thr*entity*e ships, and landed at Certicesford, and ouerthrew a number of Britains that came against them in order of battell, and so by the comming of those his nephues being valiant and hardie capteins, the part of Certicus became much stronger. Abut the same time Elle king of the Southsaxons departed this life, after whome succ*entity*eded his sonne Cissa, of whome we find little left in writing to be made account of.</p>
<p>About the yeare of our Lord 519, and in the yeare after the comming of the Saxons 71, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt.</emph> Britains ouerthrowne by the Saxons.</note>

 which was in the 26 yeare of the emperour Anastasius, the Britains fought with Certicus and his sonne Kenrike at Certicesford, where the capteins of the Britains stood to it manfullie: but in the end they were discomfited, and great slaughter was made there of them by the Saxons, and greater had b*entity*ene, if the night comming on had not parted them, and so manie were saued.</p>
<p>From that day forward Certicus was reputed *entity* taken for king of Westsaxons, *entity* so began 

<note place="marg">The kingdom of Westsaxons.</note>

 the same kingdome at that time, which was (as W. Harison noteth) in the y*entity*ere of Christ 519, after the building of Rome 1270, of the world 4485, of the comming of the Saxons 70, of Iustinus Anicius emperour of the east, the first and third of the renowmed prince Patricius Arthurus then reigning ouer the Britains. The said kingdome also conteined the countries of Wiltshire, Summersetshire, Barkeshire, Dorsetshire, and Cornewall, hauing on the east Hamshire, on the north the riuer of Thames, and on the south and west the Ocean sea. Howbeit, at the first the kings of the Westsaxons had not so large dominions, but they dailie wan ground vpon the Britains, and so in the end by inlarging their confines, they came to inioy all the foresaid countries, and the whole at the last.</p>
<p>In the ninth y*entity*ere of the reigne of Certicus, he eftsoones fought with the Saxons at Certicesford 

<note place="marg">Certicesford.</note>

 aforesaid, where great slaughter was made on both parts. This Certicesford was in times past called Nazalcoy of the late remembred Nazaleod king of the Britains. About this <pb n="574"/>season at sundrie times diuers great companies of the Saxons came ouer into Britaine out of Germanie, and got possession of the countries of Mercia and Eastangle: but as yet those of Mercia had no one king that gouerned them, but were vnder certeine noble men that got possession of diuers parts in that countrie, by means wherof great warres and manie incounters insued, with a common waste of land both arable and habitable, whiles each one being ambitiouslie minded, *entity* heaping to themselues such powers as they were able to make, by swoord and bloudshed chose rather to haue their fortune decided, than by reason to suppresse the rage of their vnrulie affections. For such is the nature of men in gouernement, whether they be interessed to it by succession, or possessed of it by vsurpation, or placed in it by lawfull constitution, (vnlesse they be guided by some supernaturall influence of diuine conceit) if they be more than one, they cannot away with equalitie, for regiment admitteth no companion: but euerie one s*entity*eketh to aduance himselfe to a singularitie of honour, wherein he will not (to die for it) participate with another, which maie easilie be obserued in this our historicall discourse.</p>

<note place="marg">ARTHUR.</note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> the deceasse of Vter Pendragon (as we doo find in the British histories) his sonne Arthur, a yoong towardlie gentleman, of the age of 15 y*entity*eres or thereabouts, began his reigne ouer 

<note place="marg"><date>516.</date></note>

 the Britains in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 516, or as Matt. Westmin. saith 517, in the 28 y*entity*ere of the emperour Anastasius, and in the third y*entity*ere of the reignes of Childebert, Clothare, Clodamire, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> hath noted 518</note>

 and Theodcrike, brethren that were kings of the Frenchmen. Of this Arthur manie things are written beyond credit, for that there is no ancient author of authoritie that confirmeth the same: but surelie as may be thought he was some woorthie man, and by all likelihood a great enimie to the Saxons, by reason whereof the Welshmen which are the verie Britains in d*entity*ed, haue him in famous remembrance. He fought (as the common report goeth of him) 12 notable battels against the Saxons, *entity* in euerie of them went away with the victorie, but yet he could not driue them quite out of the land, but that they kept still the countries which they had in possession, as Kent, Sutherie, Norfolke, and others: howbeit some writers testifie, that they held these countries as tributaries to Arthur.</p>

<pb n="575"/>
<p>But truth it is (as diuers authors agr*entity*e) that he held continuall warre against them, and also against the Picts, the which were allied with the Saxons: for as in the Scotish histories is conteined, euen at the first beginning of his reigne, the two kings of the Scots and Picts s*entity*emed to enuie his aduancement to the crowne of Britaine, bicause they had maried the two sisters of the two brethren, Aurelius Ambrosius, and Vter Pendragon, that is to say, Loth king of Picts had married Anne their eldest sister, and Conran king of Scots had in mariage Alda their yoonger sister, so that bicause Arthur was begotten out of wedlocke, they thought it stood with more reason, that the kingdome of the Britains should haue descended vnto the sisters sonnes, rather than to a bastard, namelie Loth the Pictish king, which had issue by his wife Anna, sore repined at the matter.</p>
<p>Wherefore at the first, when he saw that by suit he could not preuaile, he ioined in league with the Saxons, and aiding them against Arthur, lost many of his men of warre being ouerthrowne in battell, which he had sent vnto the succours of Colgerne the Saxon prince that ruled as then in the north parts. But finallie a league was concluded betwixt Arthur and the foresaid Loth king of Picts, vpon certeine conditions, as in the Scotish historie is expressed, where ye may read the same, with many other things touching the acts of Arthur, somewhat in other er than our writers haue recorded.</p>
<p>*entity* The British authors declare, that Arthur (immediatlie after he had receiued the crowne of Dubright bishop of Caerleon) went with his power of Britains against the Saxons of Northumberland, which had to their capteine (as before is said) one Colgrime or Colgerne, whome Arthur discomfited and chased into the citie of Yorke, within which place Arthur besieged him, till at length the same Colgrime escaped out of the citie, *entity* leauing it in charge 

<note place="marg">Yorke besieged.</note>

 with his brother called Bladulfe, passed ouer into Germanie vnto Cheldrike king of that 

<note place="marg">Cheldrike commeth in aid of Colgrime. <emph>Matt. Westm.</emph> saith but 700.</note>

 countrie, of whom he obteined succor, so that the said Cheldrike made prouision of men and ships, and came himselfe ouer into Scotland, hauing in his companie fift*entity*ene hundred sailes one with an other.</p>
<p>When Arthur was aduertised thereof, was raised his siege, and withdrew to London, sending letters with all speed vnto Howell king of little Britaine in France, that was his sisters sonne, requiring of him in most earnest wise his aid. Howell incontinentlie assembled his people, to 

<note place="marg">Howell king of Britaine commeth ouer in aid of Arthur.</note>

 the number of fifteene thousand men, and taking the sea, landed with them at Southhampton, where Arthur was readie to receiue him with great ioy and gladnesse. From thence they drew northwards, where both the hosts of Arthur and Howell being assembled togither, marched forward to Lincolne, which citie Cheldrike did as then besiege. Here Arthur and Howell assailed the Saxons with great force *entity* no lesse manhood, and at length after great 

<note place="marg">Cheldrike ouerthrowne in baitell.</note>

 slaughter made of the enimies, they obteined the victorie, and chased Cheldrike (with the residue of the Saxons that were left aliue) vnto a wood where they comassed them about within the same, in such wise, that in the ende they were constrined to y*entity*eld themselue, with condition that they might be suffered to depart on foot to their ships, and so auoid the land, leauing their horsse, armour, and other furniture vnto the Britains.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon the Britains taking good hostages for assurance, permitted the Saxons to go their waies, and so Cheldrike and his people got them to their ships, in purpose to returne into their countrie: but being on the sea, they were forced by wind to change their course, and comming on the coasts of the west parts of Britaine, they arriued at Totnesse, and contrarie to the couenanted articles of their last composition with Arthur, inuaded the countrie anew, and taking such armour as they could find, marched foorth in robbing and spoiling the people, till they came to Bath, which towne the Britains kept and defended against them, not suffering them by anie meanes to enter there, wherevpon the Saxons inuironed it with a strong siege. Arthur informed heereof, with all sp*entity*ed hasted thither, and giuing the enimies

 to be made king, *entity* hauing alied himselfe with Cheldrike a Saxon (not him whome Galfride, as ye haue heard, supposeth to haue b*entity*ene wounded *entity* slaine before) was readie to resist his landing, so that before he could come on land, he lost manie of his men: but yet at length he repelled the enimies, and so tooke land at Sandwich, where he first arriued, and ioining in battell with his enimies, he discomfited them, but not without great losse of his people: speciallie he sore lamented the death of Gawaine the brother of Mordred, which like a faithfull gentleman, regarding more his honour and lciall truth than n*entity*erenesse of bloud and coosenage, chose rather to fight in the quarrell of his liege king and leuing maister, than to take part with his naturall brother in an vniust cause, and so there in the battell was slaine, togither also with Angussell, to whom Arthur afore time had committed the gouernment <pb n="577"/>of Scotland. Mordred fled from this battell, and getting ships sailed westward, and finallie landed in Cornwall. King Arthur caused the corps of Gawaine to be buried at 

<note place="marg">Gawaine buried at Douer.</note>

 Douer (as some hold opinion:) but William Malmesburie supposeth, he was buried in Wales, as after shall be shewed. The dead bodie of Angussell was conueied into Scotland, and was there buried. When that Arthur had put his enimies to flight, and had knowledge into what parts Mordred was withdrawne, with all sp*entity*ed he reinforced his armie with new supplies of souldiers called out of diuerse parties, and with his whole puissance hasted forward, not resting till he came n*entity*ere to the place where Mordred was incamped, with such an armie as he could assemble togither out of all parties where he had anie friends. *entity* H*entity*ere (as it app*entity*ereth by Iohn Leland, in his booke intituled, "The assertion of Arthur") it may be douted in what place Mordred was incamped: but Geffrey of Monmouth sheweth, that after Arthur had discomfited Mordred in Kent at the first landing, it chanced so that Mordred escaped and fled to Winchester, whither Arthur followed him, and there giuing him battell the second time, did also put him to flight. And following him from thence, fought eftsoones with him at a place called Camblane, or Kemelene in Cornwall, or (as some authors haue) n*entity*ere vnto Glastenburie.</p>
<p>This battell was fought to such proofe, that finallie Mordred was slaine, with the more 

<note place="marg"><emph>Richard Turnes.</emph></note>

 part of his whole armie, and Arthur receiuing diuers mortall wounds died of the same shortlie after, when he had reigned ouer the Britains by the tearme of 26 y*entity*eres. His corps was buried at Glastenburie aforesaid, in the churchyard, betwixt two pillers: where it was found in the daies of king Henrie the second, about the yeere of our Lord 1191, which was in the last y*entity*ere of the reigne of the same Henrie, more than six hundred y*entity*eres after the buriall thereof. He was laid 16 foot d*entity*epe vnder ground, for doubt that his enimies the Saxons should haue found him. But those that digged the ground there to find his bodie, after they had entered about seuen foot d*entity*epe into the earth, they found a mightie broad stone with a leaden crosse fastened to that part which laie downewards toward the corps, conteining this inscription:
<quote rend="blockquote"><l lang="la">"H*entity*c iacet sepultus inclytus rex Arthurius in insula Aualoiae."</l></quote></p>

<p>This inscription was grauen on that side of the crosse which was next to the stone: so that till the crosse was taken from the stone, it was vns*entity*ene. His bodie was found, not inclosed within a toome of marble or other stone curiouslie wrought, but within a great tr*entity*e made hollowe for the nonce like a trunke, the which being found and digged vp, was opened, and therein were found the kings bones, of such maruellous bignesse, that the shinbone of his leg being set on the ground, reached vp to the middle thigh of a verie tall man: as a moonke of that abbeie hath written, which did liue in those daies, and saw it. *entity* But Gyraldus Cambrensis (who also liued in those daies, and spake with the abbat of the place, by whom the bones of this Arthur were then found) affirmeth, that by report of the same abbat, he learned, that the shinbone of the said Arthur being set vp by the leg of a verie tall man (the which the abbat shewed to the same Gyraldus) came aboue the kn*entity*e of the same man the length of three fingers breadth, which is a great deale more likelie than the other. Furthermore the skull of his head was of a woonderfull largenesse, so that the space of his forehead betwixt his two eies was a span broad. There app*entity*ered in his head the signes and prints of ten wounds or more: all the which were growne into one wem, except onelie that whereof it should s*entity*em he died, which being greater than the residue, app*entity*ered verie plaine. Also in opening the toome of his wife qu*entity*ene Gueneuer, that was buried with him, they found the tresses of hir haire whole and perfect, and finelie platted, of colour like to the buruished gold, which being touched, immediatlie fell to dust. The abbat, which then was gouernour of the house, was named Stephan, or Henrie de Blois, otherwise de

<head type="title"> Vpon what occasion the graue of king Arthur was sought for, the follie of such discouered as beleeued that he should returne and reigne againe as king in Britaine, whether it be a fiction or a veritie that there was such an Arthur or no; discordanca among writers about the place of Gawains buriall and Arthurs death; of queene Gueneuer the wife of king Arthur, hir beautie and dishonest life, great disagreement among writers touching Arthur and his wiues to the impeachment of the historie, of his life and death.</head>
<head type="unitnum">The Xiiij. Chapter.</head>

<p>THE occasion that mooued king Henrie the second to cause his nephue the foresaid abbat to search for the graue of king Arthur, was, for that he vnderstood by a Welsh minstrell or Bardh (as they call him) that could sing manie histories in the Welsh language of the acts of the ancient Britains, that in the forsaid churchyard at Glastenburie, betwixt the said two pillers the bodie of Arthur was to be found sixt*entity*ene foot d*entity*epe vnder the ground. Gyraldus Cambrensis affirmeth, that the tr*entity*e in the which Arthurs bodie was found so inclosed, was an oke, but other suppose that it was an alder tr*entity*e, bicause that in the same place a great number of that kind of tr*entity*es doo grow, and also for that it is not vnknowne, that an alder lieng vnder ground where moisture is, will long continue without rotting.</p>
<p>*entity* By the finding thus of the bodie of Arthur buried (as before ye haue heard) such as hitherto beleeued that he was not dead, but conueied awaie by the fairies into some pleasant 

<note place="marg">As for example in a caue n*entity*ere a water called pond perillou, at Salisburie. where he and his knights should sl*entity*epe armed, till an other knight should be borne that should come and awake them. <emph>Will. Malmes. lib.</emph> 1. <emph>de regibus Ang.</emph></note>

 place, where he should remaine for a time, and then to returne againe, and reigne in as great authoritie as euer he did before, might well perceiue themselues deceiued in crediting so vaine a fable. But yet (where it might otherwise be doubted, whether anie such Arthur was at all, as the British histories mention, bicause neither Gyldas nor Beda in their woorks speake anie thing of him) it may app*entity*ere, the circumstances considered, that suerly such one there was of that name, hardie and valiant in armes, though not in diuerse points so famous as some writers paint him out. William Malmesburie a writer of good credit and authoritie amongst the learned, hath these woords in his first booke intituled "De regibus Anglorum," saieng: "But he being dead [meaning Vortimer] the force of the Britains waxed f*entity*eble, their decaied hope went backward apace: and euen then suerlie had they gon to destruction, if Ambrosius (who alone of the Romans remained yet aliue, and was king after Vortigerne) had not kept vnder and staied the loftie barbarous people, that is to say the Saxons, by the notable aid and assistance of the valiant Arthur."</p>
<p>This is the same Arthur, of whom the trifling tales of the Britains euen to this day fantasticallie doo descant and report woonders: but woorthie was he doubtlesse, of whom feined fables should not haue so dreamed, but rather that true histories might haue set foorth his woorthie praises, as he that did for a long season susteine and hold vp his countrie that was readie to go to vtter ruine and decaie, incouraging the bold harts of the Britains vnto the warre, and finallie in the siege of Badon hill, he set vpon nine hundred of the enimies, and with incredible slaughter did put them all to flight. On the contrarie part, the English Saxons, although they were tossed with sundrie haps of fortune, yet still they renewed their bands with new supplies of their countriemen that came out of Germanie, and so with bolder courage assailed their enimies, and by little and little causing them to giue place, spread themselues ouer the whole Ile. For although there were manie battels, in the which sometime the Saxons and sometime the Britains got the better, yet the greater number of Saxons that were slaine, the greater number of them still came ouer to the succour of their countriemen, being called in and sent for out of euerie quarter about them.</p>
<p>H*entity*ere is also to be noted, that where the British historie declareth, that Gawaine or Gallowine 

<note place="marg">Gawaine where he is buried.</note>

 being slaine in the battell fought betwixt Arthur and Mordred in Kent, was buried at <pb n="580"/>Douer, so that his bones remained there to be shewed a long time after: yet by that which 

<note place="marg">Wil. Malm. lib. S. de regib.</note>

 the foresaid William Malmesburie writeth in the third booke of his volume intituled "De regibus Anglorum," the contrarie maie s*entity*eme true: his woords are these. "Then (saith he) in the prouince of Wales, which is called Rosse, the sepulture of Gallowine was found who was nephue to Arthur by his sister, not going out of kind from so woorthie an vncle. He reigned in that part of Britaine which vnto this day is called Walwichia, a knight for his high prowesse most highlie renowmed, but expelled out of his kingdome by the brother and nephue of Hengist, of whome in the first booke we haue made mention, first requiting his banishment with great detriment and losse to those his enimies, wherein he was partaker by iust desert of his vncles woorthie praise, for that he staied (for a great manie y*entity*eres) the destruction of his countries which was now running headlong into vtter ruine and decaie. But Arthurs graue no where app*entity*ereth: yet the others toome (as I haue said) was found in the daies of William the conqueror, king of England, vpon the sea side, and conteined in length fouret*entity*ene foot, where he was (as some say) wounded by his enimies, and cast vp by shipwracke. But other write, that he was slaine at a publike feast or banket by his owne countriemen." Thus saith William Malmesburie.</p>
<p>*entity* But heere you must consider, that the said Malmesburie departed this life about the beginning of the reigne of king Henrie the second, certeine y*entity*ers before the bones of Arthur were found (as ye haue heard.) But omitting this point as n*entity*edles to be controuerssed, *entity* letting all dissonant opinions of writers passe, as a matter of no such moment that we should n*entity*ed to sticke therein as in a glewpot; we will proc*entity*ed in the residue of such collections as we find necessarilie pertinent to the continuation of this historie and now we will say somewhat of qu*entity*ene Guenhera or Guenouer, the wife of the foresaid king Arthur.</p>
<p>Some iudge that she tooke hir name of hir excellent beautie, bicause Guinne or Guenne in the Welsh toong signifieth faire, so that she was named Guennere or rather Guenlhean, euen (as you would say) the faire or beautifull Elenor or Helen. She was brought vp in the house of one Cador earle of Cornewall before Arthur maried hir: and as it appeareth by writers, she was euill reported of, as noted of incontinencie *entity* breach of faith to hir husband, in maner as for the more part women of excellent beautie hardlie escape the venemous blast of euill toongs, and the sharpe assaults of the followers of Venus. The British historie affirmeth, that she did not onelie abuse hir selfe by vnlawfull companie with Mordred, but that also in Arthurs absence she consented to take him to husband. It is likewise found recorded by an old writer, that Arthur besieged on a time the marishes n*entity*ere to Glastenburie, for displeasure that he bare to a certeine lord called Melua, who had rauished Gueneuer, and led hir into those marishes, and there did k*entity*epe hir. Hir corps notwithstanding (as before is recited) was interred togither with Arthurs, so that it is thought she liued not long after his deceasse.</p>
<p>Arthur had two wiues (as Gyraldus Cambrensis affirmeth) of which the latter (saith he) was buried with him, and hir bones found with his in one sepulchre, but yet so diuided, that two parts of the toome towards the head were appointed to receiue the bones of the man, and the third part towards the f*entity*et conteined the womans bones, apart by themselues. Here is to be remembred, that Hector Boetius writeth otherwise of the death of Arthur than before in this booke is mentioned, *entity* also that Gueneuer being taking prisoner by the Picts, was conueied into Scotland, where finallie she died, and was there buried in Angus, as in the Scotish chronicles further appeareth. And this may be true, if he had thr*entity*e sundrie wiues, each of them bearing the name of Gueneuer, as sir Iohn Price dooth auouch that he had. Now bicause of contrarietie in writers touching the great acts atchiued by this Arthur, and also for that some difference there is amongst them, about the time in which he should reigne, manie haue doubted of the whole historie which of him is written (as before ye haue heard.) *entity* But others there be of a constant bel*entity*efe, who hold it for a 

<note place="marg"><emph>Dauid Pow. pag.</emph> 238, 239.</note>

 grounded truth, that such a prince there was; and among all other a late writer, who falling <pb n="581"/>into necessarie mention of prince Arthur, frameth a sp*entity*ech apologeticall in his and their behalfe that were princes of the British bloud, discharging a short but yet a sharpe inuectiue against William Paruus, Polydor Virgil, and their complices, whom he accuseth of lieng toongs, enuious detraction, malicious slander, reprochfull and venemous language, wilfull ignorance, dogged enuie, and cankerd minds; for that they speake vnreuerentlie and contrarie to the knowsne truth concerning those thrisenoble princes. Which defensitiue he would not haue deposed, but that he takes the monuments of their memories for vndoubted verities.</p>
<p>The British histories and also the Scotish chronicles doo agr*entity*e, that he liued in the daies of the emperour Iustinian, about the fift*entity*enth y*entity*ere of whose reigne he died, which was in 

<note place="marg"><date>542.</date></note>

 the y*entity*ere of our Lord 542, as diuerse doo affirme. Howbeit some write farther from all likelihood, that he was about the time of the emperor Zeno, who began his reigne about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 474. The writer of the booke intituled "Aurea historia" affirmeth, that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Aurea historia. I. Leland.</emph></note>

 in the tenth y*entity*ere of Cerdicus king of Westsaxons, Arthur the warriour rose against the Britains. Also Diouionensis writeth, that Cerdicus fighting oftentimes with Arthur, if he were ouercome in one moneth, he arose in an other moneth more fierce and strong to giue battell than before. At length Arthur wearied with irkesomnes, after the twelfth y*entity*ere of the comming of Cerdicus, gaue vnto him vpon his homage doone and fealtie receiued, the shires of Southampton and Somerset, the which countries Cerdicius named Westsaxon. 

<note place="marg">Westsaxon.</note>

 This Cerdicius or Cerdicius came into Britaine about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 495. In the 24 yere after his comming hither, that is to say, about the y*entity*ere of your Lord 519, he began his reigne ouer the Westsaxons, and gouerned them as king by the space of 15 y*entity*eres, as before ye haue heard. But to follow the course of our chronicles accordinglie as we haue begun, we must allow of their accounts herein as in other places, and so proc*entity*ed.</p>

<p>"Of this hainous and wicked offense Constantine the tyrannicall whelpe of the lionesse of Deuonshire is not ignorant, who this yeare, after the receiuing of his dreadfull oth, whereby he bound himselfe that in no wise he should hurt his subiects (God first, and then his oth, with the companie of saints, and his mother being there present) did notwithstanding in the reuerent laps of the, two mothers, as the church, and their carnall mother, vnder the coule of the holie abbat, deuoure with sword and speare in stead of t*entity*eth, the tender sides, yea and the entrailes of two children of noble and kinglie race, and likewise of their two gouernours, yea and that (as I said) amongest the sacred altars: the armies of which persons so slaine, not stretched foorth to defend themselues with weapons (the which few in those daies handled more valiantlie than they) but stretched foorth (I saie) to God and to his altar in the day of iudgement, shall set vp the reuerent ensignes of their patience and faith at the gates of the citie of Christ, which so haue couered the sent of the celestiall sacrifice, as it were with the red mantle of their cluttered bloud.</p>
<p>"These things he did not after anie good d*entity*eds doone by him de*entity*eruing praise: for manie yeares before, ouercome with the often and changeable filths of adulterie, *entity* forsaking his lawfull wife contrarie to the lawes of God, *entity*c: he now brought foorth this crime of quelling his owne kinsmen, and violating the church, but neither being loosed from the snares of his former euills, he increaseth the new with the old." *entity* Thus in effect hath Gyldas written of this Constantine, with more: for turning his tale to him, he reproueth him of his faults, and counselleth him to repent.</p>

This Aurelius Conanus (as is recorded by some writers) was of a noble heart, fr*entity*e and liberall, but giuen much to the maintenance of strife and discord amongst his people, light of credit, and namelie had an open eare to receiue and heare the reports of such as accused other.

Of this Aurelius Conanus Gyldas writeth, calling vnto him after he had made an end with his predecessor Constantine, saieng in this wise: "And thou lions whelpe, as saith the prophet, Aurelius Conanus what doost thou? Art thou not swallowed vp in the filthie mire of murthering thy kinsmen, of committing fornications and adulteries like to the other before mentioned, if not more deadlie, as it were with the waues and surges of the drenching seas ouerwhelming th*entity*e with hir vnmercifull rage? Dooest thou not in hating the peace of thy countrie as a deadlie serpent, and thirsting after ciuill wars and spoiles (oftentimes vniustlie gotten) shut vp against thy soule the gates of celestiall peace and refreshment? Thou being left alone as a withering tr*entity*e in the middle of a field, call to remembrance (I praie th*entity*e) the vaine youthfull fantasie and ouertimelie death of thy fathers and thy brethren. Shalt thou being set apart, and chosen foorth of all thy linage for thy godlie deserts, be reserued to liue an hundred yeares, or remaine on earth till thou be as old as Methusalem? No no." And after these reprehensions, with further threatnings of Gods vengeance, he exhorted him to amendment of life, and so proceedeth to talke with Vortiporus, whome he nameth the king, or rather the tyrant of Southwales, as after shall be rehearsed.</p>

 of Woden. For where the said Woden had three sonnes, Weldecius, Withlegris, and Beldecius; 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph> The kingdom of Brenitia began.</note>

 of the first, the kings of Kent were lineallie extracted: of the second, the kings of Mertia: and of the third sonne came the kings of Westsaxon, and also of him was this Ida descended, being the ninth in lineall succession from the said Beldecius and the tenth from Woden. The same Ida was vndoubtedlie a right noble personage, and changed first that dukedome into a kingdome; where before that time the Saxons that ruled there, were subiects vnto the kings of Kent. Whether he tooke vpon him of his owne accord to vsurpe the kinglie title and roiall authorities, or whether that the same was giuen to him by consent of other, the certeintie appeareth not. But sure it is, that he being a woorthie prince, did not degenerate from his noble ancestors inuincible in warre abroad and at home, qualifieng <pb n="584"/>his kinglie seueritie with a naturall kind of courteous humanitie. The bounds of his kingdome called (as is said) Brenitia, began in the south at the riuer of Tine, and ended in the north at the Forth in Scotland, in the British toong called Werd.</p>

 seuerall kings, and afterwards at other times they were ioined in one, and gouemed by one onelie king, and named the kingdome of Northumberland, which in processe of time was much inlarged, so that it included the shires of Yorke, Notingham, Darbie, Lancaster, the bishoprike of Durham, Copland, and other countries betwixt the east and the west seas, 

<note place="marg">The riuer of Mersie.</note>

 euen vnto the riuer of Mersie. The foresaid Ella was sonne to Iffus, being descended from Woden, as the 12 in succession from him, though not by right line as William Malmesburie hath noted, Ida (as the same Malmesburie dooth testifie) reigned 14 yeares.</p>
<p>Now Ella who was successor to Ida (as he saith) reigned thirtie yeares, and verie valiantlie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 inlarged his kingdome. But one author writeth how Ida reigned but 12 yeares, and that he builded the castell of Bamburge, first fensing it with pales, and after with a wall of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 stone. The same Ida had by his wife six sonnes, begotten in lawfull bed, Ada, Ebric 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West.</emph></note>

 Theodoric, Athelric, Osmer, and Theofred. Moreouer he begat of certeine concubines (which he kept) six bastard sonnes, Oga, Aleric, Ettha, Osbale, Segor, and Segother. These came altogither into this land, and arriued at Flernesburke with fortie ships, as Matthaeus Westmonasteriensis hath recorded. The partition of the kingdome of Northumberland chanced after the deceasse of Ida, as the same author signifieth: for Ada the sonne of the foresaid Ida succ*entity*eded his father in the kingdome of Brenitia, reigning therein seuen yeares: and Ella the sonne of Histria, a most valiant duke, began to gouerne Deira, as both the said Matth. Westin. and others doo affirme.</p>

<note place="marg">VORTIPORUS. <emph>Matth. West.</emph> noteth 578.</note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">VORTIPORUS</hi> the sonne of Aurelius Conanus succeeded his father, and began to reigne ouer the Britains, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 576, in the 11, yeare of the emperour Flauius Anicius Iustinus, in the fourth yeare of the reigne of Childeric king of France, and in the fourth yeare of Clephis the Gothish king in Italie. This Vortiporus vanquished the Saxons in battell, as the British histories make mention, and valiantlie defended his land and subjects the Britains, from the danger of them and other their allies. In the time of this kings reigne, the foresaid Ella began to rule in the south part of the kingdome of Northumberland called Deira, as before is mentioned, according to the account of some authors, who also take this Vortiporus to begin his reigne in the yeare 548. After that Vortiporus had ruled 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> noteth 3 yeares.</note>

 the Britans the space of 4 yeares, he departed this life, and left no issue behind him to succ*entity*ed him in the kingdome.</p>
<p>Against this Vortiporus Gyldas also whetting his toong, beginneth with him thus: "And why standest thou as one starke amazed? Thou (I say) Vortiporus the tyrant of Southwales, like to the panther in maner and wickednesse diuerslie spotted as it were with manie colors, with thy hoarie head in thy throne, full of deceits, crafts and wiles, and defiled euen from the lowest part of thy bodie to the crowne of thy head, with diuers *entity* sundrie murthers committed on thine owne kin, and filthie adulteries, thus proouing a naughtie sonne of a good king, as Manasses was to Ezechias. How chanceth it that the violent streames of sinnes which thou swallowest vp like pleasant wine, or rather art deuoured of them, (the end of thy life by little and little now drawing n*entity*ere) can not yet satisfie the? What meanest thou that with fornication of all euills, as it were the full heape, thine owne wife being put away, thou by hir honest death dooest oppresse thy soule with a certeine burthen that can not be auoided, of thine vnshamefast daughter? Consume not (I pray th*entity*e) the residue of thy daies to the offense of God, *entity*c." These and the like woords vttered he, exhorting him to repentance, with admonitions taken out of the scriptures both for his comfort and warning.</p>

<pb n="585"/>
<p>*entity* If the circumstance of this that Gyldas writeth of Vortiporus be marked, it may be perceiued, that Geffrey of Monmouth, and also Matthew of Westminster, the author of the floures of histories, are deceiued, in that they take him to be the sonne of Aurelius Conanus: and rather it may be gathered, that not onlie the same Aurelius Conanus and Vortiporus, but also Constantinus, yea *entity* Cuneglasus, and Maglocunus, of the which he also intreateth (as partlie shall be hereafter touched) liued and reigned all at one time in seuerall parts of this lie, and not as monarchs of the whole British nation, but as rulers each of them in his quarter, after the maner as the state of Ireland hath: b*entity*ene in times past before the countrie came vnder the English subiection, if my coniecture herein doo not deceiue me.</p>

<p>AFTER the deceasse of Vortiporus, Malgo the nephue of Aurelius Conanus (as some 

<note place="marg">MALGO. <emph>Matth. West.</emph> hath noted 581.</note>

 write) was made king of Britaine, *entity* began his reigne ouer the Britaines, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 580, in the fift*entity*enth y*entity*ere of the emperour Iustinian, and in the 37 y*entity*ere of the reigne 

<note place="marg"><date>580.</date></note>

 of Childerike king of the Frenchmen. This Malgo is reported to haue b*entity*ene the comeliest 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 gentleman in beautie and shape of personage that was to be found in those daies amongst all the Britains, and therewith of a bold and hardie courage. He manfullie defended the country which he had in gouernance from the malice of the Saxons, and subdued the out Iles, as Orkenie and others. But notwithstanding the noble qualities with the which his person was adorned, yet he spotted them all with the filthie sinne of Sodomie, so that he fell into the hatred of almightie God, and being pursued of the Saxons, receiued manie ouerthrowes at their hands, as by the report of the English writers is gathered more at large. Finallie, when he had reigned fiue y*entity*eres and od moneths, he departed this life.</p>
<p>It s*entity*emeth that this Malgo is named by Gyldas, Maglocunus, the which Gyldas (before 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. Westm.</emph> counteth not past fine yeres to his reigne though other affirme that he reigned 35 y*entity*eres.</note>

 he speaketh of him) inueieth against one Cuneglasus, whome he reprooueth, for that he warred both against God and man: against God with grieuous sinnes, as namelie adulterie, in forsaking the companie of his lawfull wife, and k*entity*eping to concubine a sister of hirs, that had professed chastitie: *entity* against man with materiall armor and weapons, which he vsed to the destruction of his owne countrimen, with whom he kept warres, and not against the enimies of the common wealth.</p>
<p>From Cuneglasus he commeth to the foresaid Maglocunus, whome he nameth the dragon of the Iles, and the expeller of man;e tyrants, not onelie out of their kingdoms, but also out of life, the last of whom he treateth (as he himselfe saith) but the first in all misch*entity*efe *entity* euill, greater than manie in power, and likewise in malice: verie liberall in gluing, but more plentifull in sinne, strong and valiant in arms, but stronger in destruction of his owne soule. And so proc*entity*eding, chargeth him with the sinne of the Sodomits, *entity* sore blameth him, for that where it had pleased God to make him higher than all other dukes of Britaine <pb n="586"/>in kingdome and degr*entity*e, he did not shew himselfe better, but contrarilie far woorse than they both in maners and conditions. He declareth also a little after, that this Maglocune in his yoong y*entity*eres slue in battell his vncle being king, with the most valiant souldies in maner that he had. Also that where the said Maglocune tooke vpon him the profession of a moonke, he after renounced the same, and became a woorsse Iiuer than euer he was before, abandoning his, wife, and k*entity*eping his brothers sonnes wife, while hir husband yet liued.</p>
<p>Thus by that which Gyldas writeth of the kings and rulers of the Britains, which lined in his daies, ye may perceiue that they were giuen to all manner of wickednesse, and namelie to ciuill dissention, rapine, adulterie, and fornication: so that it may be thought, that GOD stirred vp the Saxons to be a scourge to them, and to worke his iust vengeance vpon them for their wickednesses and abhominable offenses dailie c*entity*mitted against his diuine maiestie, so that we find recorded by writers, how that the Saxons in diuers conflicts against the Britains had the better, and also tooke from them diuers townes, as alreadie partly hath beene and also hereafter shall be shewed.</p>
<p>It is furthermore to be remembred, that about the 14 yeere of the Britaine king Conanus 

<note place="marg"><date>559.</date></note>

 his reigne, which was about the end of the yere of Christ 559, Kenrike king of the Westsaxons, departed this life, after he had reigned xxv. y*entity*eres complet. This Kenrke was a 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 victorious prince, and fought diuers battels against the Britains. In the 18 yeere of his reigne which was the 551 of Christ, we find that he fought against them, being come at that time vnto Salisburie, and after great slaughter made on both parts, at length the victorie remained with the Saxons, and the Britains were chased. Againe in the two and twentith y*entity*ere of his reigne, and 555 y*entity*ere of Christ, the same Kenrike and his sonne Cheuling fought with a great power of Britains at Branburie.</p>
<p>The Britains were diuided into nine companies, thr*entity*e in the fore wrard, thr*entity*e in the battell, and thr*entity*e in the rere ward, with their horssemen and archers, after the maner of the Romans. The Saxons being ranged in one entire battell, valiantlie assailed them, and notwithstanding the shot of the Britains, yet they brought the matter to the triall of handblowes, till at length by the comming on of the night, the victorie remained doubtfull: and no maruell is to be made therof (saith Henrie archdeacon of Huntington) sith the Saxons were men of huge stature, great force *entity* valiant courage. The same y*entity*ere that Kenrike deceassed, Ida the king of Northumberland also died": he was (as ye haue heard) a right valiant prince, *entity* inlarged the dominion of the Saxons greatlie, he ouercame Loth king of the Picts in battell, and Corran king of Scots.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>560.</date></note>

<p>Also about the y*entity*ere of Christ 560, Conanus (as yet gouerning the Britains) Irmenrike king of Kent departed this life, of whome ye haue heard before, *entity* Ethelbert his sonne succ*entity*eded 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 him 52 y*entity*eres. Then after that the foresaid thr*entity*e princes were dead (as before ye haue heard) they had that succ*entity*eded them in their estates as here followeth. After Kenrike, his sonne Ceaulinus or Cheuling succ*entity*eded in gouernement of the Westsaxons: and after Ida, one Ella or Alla reigned in Northumberland: after Irmenrike followed his sonne Ethelbert in rule ouer the Kentish Saxons.</p>
<p>This Ethelbert, in processe of time grew to be a mightie prince, but yet in the begining 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 of his reigne he had but sorie successe against some of his enimies: for hauing to doo with 

<note place="marg">Ali*entity*s Wiphanduae.</note>

 the foresaid Cheuling king of Westsaxons, he was of him ouercome in battell at Wilbasdowne, where he lost two of his dukes or cheefe capteins, beside other people. This was the first battell that was fought betwixt the Saxons, one against another within this land, after their first comming into the same. And this chanced in the yere of our Lord 567, being the second y*entity*ere of the emperour iustinus.</p>

At this battell fought at Diorth, were present thr*entity*e kings of the Britains, whose names were these: Coinmagill, Candidan, and Farimnagill, which were slaine there through the permission of almightie God as then refusing his people, the which through their heinous sinnes and great wickednesses, had most gr*entity*euouslie offended his high and diuine maiestie, as by Gyldas it may euidentlie appeare. For they had declined from the lawes of the Lord, and were become abhominable in his sight, euen from the prince to the poore man, from the priest to the Leuit, so that not one estate among them walked vprightlie, but contrarie to dutie was gone astray, by reason whereof the righteous God had giuen them ouer as a prey to their enimies.</p>

 Lord 586, which was in the third y*entity*ere of the emperour Mauricius, and thirt*entity*enth of Chilperike king of France. This Careticus was a nourisher of ciuill warre and dissention amongst his owne people the Britains, so that he was hated both of God and man, as writers testifie. The Saxons vnderstanding that the Britains were not of one mind, but diuided in partakings, so as one was readie to deuoure an other, thought it good time for them to aduance their conquests, and ceassed not to pursue the Britains by force and corntinuall warre, till 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph> See more of this Gurmundus in Ireland. <emph>Ranulf. Cest.</emph></note>

 they had constreined them for refuge to withdraw into Wales. And as some haue written, the Saxons.meaning to make a full conquest of the land, sent ouer into Ireland, requiring one Gurmundus a king of the Affricans to come ouer into Britaine to helpe them against the Britains.</p>
<p>This Gurmundus appointing his brother Turgesius to pursue the conquest of Ireland, came and arriued heere in Britaine, making such cruell warre in aid of the Saxons against the Britains, that Careticus was constreined to k*entity*epe him within the citie of Chicester or Cirencester, and was there besieged, and at length by continuall assalts and skirmishes, when he had lost manie of his men, he was glad to forsake that citie, and fled into Wales.

After this, the foresaid Gurmundus destroied this land throughout in pitifull wise, and then deliuered it in possession to the Saxons, the which thankfullie receiued it: and because they were descended of those that first came ouer with Hengist, they changed the name of the land, and called it Hengistland, accordinglie as the same Hengist had in times past ordeined: the which name after for shortnesse of sp*entity*ech was somewhat altered, and so lastlie called England, and the people Englishmen. But rather it may be thought, that sith a great part of those people which came ouer into this land out of Germanie with the said Hengist, and other capteins, were of those Englishmen which inhabited Germanice, about the parts of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West.</emph></note>

Thoringhen, they called this land England, after their name, when they had first got habitation within it: and so both the land and people tooke name of them, being called <emph>Angli,</emph> a long time before they entered into this Ile, (as before is shewed out of Cornelius Tacitus and others.) But now to returne where we left.</p>

<note place="marg">It should s*entity*cme that this historie of Gurmundus is but some fained tale except it may be that he was some Dane, Norwegian or Germane.</note>

<p>Of this Gurmundus the old English writers make no mention, nor also anie ancient authors of forren parties: and yet saith the British booke, that after he had conquered this land, and giuen it to the Saxons, he passed ouer into France, and there destroied much of that land, as an enimie to the faith of Christ. For which consideration. he was the more <pb n="589"/>readie to come to the aid of the Saxons, who as yet had not receiued the christian faith, but warred against the Britains, as well to destroie the faith of Christ within this land, as to establish to themselues continuall habitations in the same. There be, that omitting to make mention of Gurmundus, write thus of the expelling of the Britains out of this land at that time, when with their king Careticus they got them into Wales.</p>

 to God and to the Britains, whose inconstancie when the English and Saxon kings perceiued, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West.</emph></note>

 with one consent they rose against him, and after manie battels chased him from citie to citie, till at length incountering with him in a pight field, they droue him beyond Seuerne into Wales. H*entity*erevpon clerks and priests were driuen out of their places with bright swoords brandishing in all parts, and fire cackling in churches, wherewith the same were consumed. The remnant of the Britains therefore withdrew into the west parts of the land, that is to say, into Cornwall, and into Vales, out of which countries they oftentimes brake out, and made insurrections vpon the Saxons, the which in maner aforsaid got possession of the chiefest parts of the land, leauing to the Britains onlie three prouinces, that is to say, Cornwall, Southwales, and Northwales, which countries were not easie to be woone, by reason of the thicke woods inuironed with d*entity*epe mareshes and waters, and full of high craggie rocks and mounteins.</p>
<p>The English and Saxon kings hauing thus remooued the Britains, inlarged the bounds of their dominions. There reigned in that season within this land, beside the Britaine kings, eight kings of the English and Saxon nations, as Ethelbert in Kent, Cissa in Sussex, Ceauline in Westsex, Creda or Crida in Mercia, Erkenwine in Essex, Titila in Estangle, Elle in Deira, and Alfrid in Bernicia. In this sort the Britains lost the possession of the more part of their ancient seats, and the faith of Christ thereby was greatlie decaied: for the churches were destroied; and the archbishops of Caerleon Arwiske, London and Yorke withdrew togither with their cleargie into the mounteins and woods within Wales, taking with them the reliks of saints, doubting the same should be destroied by the enimies, and themselues put to death if they should abide in their old habitations. Manie also fled into Britaine Armorike with a great fl*entity*ete of ships, so that the whole church or congregation (as ye may call it) of the two prouinces, Loegria and Northumberland, was left desolate in that season, to the great hinderance and decaie of the christian religion. Careticus was driuen into Wales (as before is rehearsed) about the second or third y*entity*ere of his reigne, and there continued with his Britains, the which ceassed not to indamage the Saxons from time to time as occasion still serued.</p>
<p>But here is to be noted, that the Britains being thus remoued into Wales and Cornwall, were gouerned afterwards by thr*entity*e kings, or rather tyrants, the which ceased not with ciuill warre to seeke others destruction, till finallie (as saith the British booke) they became all

In the mean? time, Ceaulinus or Cheuling king of the Westsaxons, through his owne misgouernance and tyrannie, which towards his latter daies he practised, did procure not onelie the Britains, but also his owne subiects to conspire his death, so that ioining in battell with his aduersaries at Wodensdic, in the 33 yeare of his reigne, his armie was discomfited, and he himselfe constreined to depart into exile, and shortlie after ended his life before he could find meanes to be restored.</p>

Also to haue friendship in forraine parts, he procured a wife for himselfe of the French nation, named the ladie Bertha, being king Cheriberts daughter of France; but with condition, that he should permit hir to continue and vse the rites and lawes of christian faith and religion, and to haue a bishop whose name was Luidhard, appointed to come and remaine with hir here in this land for hir better instruction in the lawes of the Lord. So that they two with other of the French nation that came ouer with them remaining in the court, and vsing to serue God in praiers and otherwise, according to the custome of the christian religion, began vndoubtedlie to giue light to the kings mind as yet darkned with the clouds of paganisme, so as the bright beames of the celestiall cl*entity*erenes of vnderstanding remooued the thicke mists of his vnbel*entity*efe in tract of time, and prepared his heart to the receuing of the gospell, which after by heauenlie prouidence was preached to him, by occasion, and in maner as followeth.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. Matth. West.</emph> saith 596. 47 saith the same author.</note>

<p>In the yeare of our Lord 596, which was about the 14 yeare of the reigne of the emperour Mauricius, and after the comming of the English Saxons into this land, about an 147 yeares almost complete the bishop of Rome, Gregorie the first of that name, and surnamed Magnus, sent Augustinus a moonke, with certeine other learned men into this Ile to preach the christian faith vnto the English Saxons, which nation as yet had not receiued the gospell. And here we hold it necessarie to shew how it is recorded by oiuers writers, that the first occasion whereby Gregorie was mooued thus to send Augustine into this land, rose by this meanes.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

<p>It chanced (whilest the same Gregorie was as vet but archdeacon of the see of Rome) certeine yoong boies were brought thither to bee sold out of Northumberland, according to <pb n="591"/>the accustomable vse of that countrie, in somuch that as we haue in our time s*entity*ene (saith W. Mal.) the people of that prouince haue not yet doubted to sell awaie their n*entity*ere kinsfolke for a small price. When those children which at that time were brought from thence to Rome, had by reason of their excellent beauties and comelie shape of lims and bodie, turned the eies in maner of all the citizens to the beholding of them, it fortuned that Gregorie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Vita Gregorii. magni.</emph></note>

 also came amongst other to behold them, and when he considered and well viewed their faire skins, their sw*entity*et visages, and beautifull bushes of their bright and yeallow heares, he demanded out of what region or land they came? Vnto whome answere was made, that they were brought out of Britaine, the inhabitants of which countrie were of the like beautifull aspect. Then he asked whether the men of that countrie were christians, or as yet intangled with blind heathenish errors? Wherevnto it was answered, that they were not christened, but followed the religion of the Gentiles. Whereat Gregorie fetching a d*entity*epe sigh, said: Ah, alas that the author of darkenesse dooth as yet possesse men of so brightsome countenances, and that with the grace of such faire shining visages, they beare about minds void of inward grace.</p>
<p>"Moreouer he demanded by what name the people were called, whereto answere was made, that they were called Angli, that is to say Englishmen. Right woorthilie (saith he) for they haue angels faces, and such as ought to be made fellow-heires with angels in heauen. Then asked he the name of the prouince from whence they were brought, and it was told him they were of Deira. It is well (said he) they are to be deliuered "De ira dei," that is to say, from the ire and wrath of God, and called to the mercie of Christ our Lord. What name (said he) hath the king of that prouince? Wherevnto answere was made that he was called Alla, wherevpon alluding to that name, he said, Alleluia ought to be soong in those parts to the praise and honor of God the creator."</p>
<p>Herevpon comming to Benedict the first of that name (as then bishop of Rome) he 

<note place="marg">Pelagius the second. <emph>Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 required him that some learned men might be sent into England to preach the gospell vnto the Englishmen, offering himselfe to be one of the number. But though Benedict was contented to grant his request, yet the Romans had him in such estimation, that they would not 

<note place="marg">Pelagius.</note>

 consent that he should depart so farre from the citie, so that by them he was at that time staied of that his godlie purpose. Howbeit when he came to be bishop, he thought to performe it though not by himselfe, yet by other: and so Augustine and his fellowes were sent by him about it (as before is said.) By the way, as they were passing in their iournie, such a sudden feare entred into their hearts, that (as some write) they returned all. Others write, 

<note place="marg"><emph>M. Fox.</emph></note>

 that Augustine was sent backe to Gregorie, to sue that they might be released of that voiage so dangerous and vncerteine amongst such a barbarous people, whose language they neither knew, nor whose rudenesse they were able to resist. Then Gregorie with pithie perswasions confirming and comforting him, sent him againe with letters vnto the bishop of Aries, willing him to helpe and aid the said Austine and his companie in all what so euer his n*entity*ede required. Also other letters he directed by the foresaid Austine vnto his fellowes, exhorting them to go forward boldlie in the Lords woorke, as by the tenor of the said epistle here following may appeare.
<quote rend="block"><l><emph>"Gregorie the seruant of Gods seruants, to the seruants of our Lord.</emph></l></quote></p>

<p>"<hi rend="smallcap">FOR</hi> as much as it is better not to take good things in hand, than after they be begun, to thinke to reuolt backe from the same againe, therefore now you may not nor cannot (dere children) but with all feruent studie and labour must needs go forward in that good businesse, which thorough the helpe of God you haueswell begun.

The Lord God keepe you safe most deere and welbeloued children. Dated the tenth before the kalends of August, in the reigne of our souereigne lord Mauricius most vertuous emperor, the fourtenth of his empire."</p>
<p>Thus emboldned and comforted through the good woords and wholesome exhortation of Gregorie, they set forward againe, and sp*entity*eding foorth their iournie, first arriued at the Ile of Thanet in Kent in the moneth of Iulie, being in number about fortie persons, of the which diuerse were interpretors, whome they brought with them out of France. These they sent vnto king Ethelbert, signifieng the occasion of their comming, who hearing the messengers within a few dates after, went into that Ile, and there abroad out of anie house sat downe, and caused Augustine and his fellowes to come before him, for he would not come vnder anie roofe with them, sore doubting to be bewitched by them, being persuaded that they were practised in nigromancie. But they comming to him, not by the power of the diuell (as they said) but by the might and power of almightie God, bearing in st*entity*ed of a 

<note place="marg">The seuenfold Tetanies of S. Gregorie were not yet deuised.</note>

 banner a crosse of siluer, and an image of our Lord and Sauiour painted in a table, and thereto singing the letanies, made intercession vnto the Lord for the euerlasting preseruation of themselues, and of all, them for whome and to whome they came.</p>
<p>Now when they being set downe by commandement of the king, had preached the woord of life to him, and to all those that came thither with him, he made them this answer, that their woords and promises were good: but for as much as the same were new *entity* vncerteine to him that had b*entity*en brought vp in the contrarie doctrine, he could not rashlie assent to their admonitions, *entity* leaue that bel*entity*efe which he and the English nation had so long a time obserued and kept: but (said he) because ye haue trauelled farre, to the intent to make vs partakers of those things which ye bel*entity*eue to be most true and perfect, we will thus much graunt vnto you, that ye shall be receiued into this countrie, and haue harbrough, with all things sufficient found vnto you for your maintenance and sustentation: neither will we hinder you, but that ye may by preaching associat and ioine as manie of our subiects as you can vnto your law and bel*entity*efe. They had therefore assigned vnto them a place to lodge in within the citie of Canturburie, which was the head citie of all his dominion. It is said that as they approched the citie according to their maner, they had a crosse borne before them, with an image of our Lord Iesus Christ, and they followed, singing this letanie, "Deprecamur te Domine in omni misericordia tua, vt auferatur furor tuus *entity* ira tua *entity* ciuitate ista *entity* de domo sancta tua, quoniam peccauimus: Alleluia." <emph>That is to say,</emph> We beseech thee *entity* Lord in all thy mercie that thy furie and wrath may be taken from this citie, and from thy holie house, for we haue sinned. Praise be to thee *entity* Lord.--After they were receiued into 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 Canturburie, they began to follow the trade of life which the apostles vsed in the primitiue church, that is to say, exercising themselues in continuall praier, watching, and preaching to as manie as they could, despising all worldlie things, as not belonging to them, receiuing onelie of them (whome they taught) things necessarie for the sustenance of their life, *entity* liuing in all points according to the doctrine which they set forth, hauing their minds readie to suffer in patience all aduersities what so euer, yea and death it selfe, for the confirming of 

<note place="marg">The christian faith receiued of the Englishmen.</note>

 that which they now preached. Herevpon, manie of the English people bel*entity*eued and were baptised, hauing in great reuerence the simplicitie of those men, and the sw*entity*etenesse of their heauenlie doctrine. There was a church n*entity*ere to the citie on the east part thereof dedicated to the honor of saint Martine, and builded of old time whilest the Romans as yet inhabited Britaine, in the which the qu*entity*ene, being (as we haue said) a christian, vsed to make hir praiers. To tills church Austine and his fellowes at their first comming accustomed to resort, and there to sing, to praie, to saie masse, to preach and to baptise, till at length the king <pb n="593"/>being conuerted, granted them licence to preach in euerie place, and to build and restore churches where they thought good. After that the king being persuaded by their doctrine, good examples giuing, and diuers miracles shewed, was once baptised, the people in great numbers began to giue eare vnto the preaching of the gospell, and renouncing their heathenish bel*entity*efe, became christians, in so much that as Gregorie remembreth, there were

Moreouer he prouided for Augustine and his fellowes a conuenient place for their habitation within the citie of Canturburie, and further gaue them necessarie reuenewes in possession for their maintenance. After that the faith of Christ was 

<note place="marg">Augustine ordeined archhishop of the English nation.</note>

 thus receiued of the English men, Augustine went into France, and there of the archbishop of Aries named Etherius was ordeined archbishop of the English nation, according to the order prescribed by Gregorie before the departure of the said Augustine from Rome.</p>
<p>After his returne into Britaine, he sent Laurence a priest, and P*entity*eter a moonke vnto 

<note place="marg">Laurence a priest.</note>

 Rome, to giue knowledge vnto Gregorie the bishop, how the Englishmen had receiued the faith, and that he was ordeined archbishop of the land, according to that he had commanded, if the woorke prospered vnder his hand as it had doone. He also required to haue Gregories aduice touching certeine ordinances to be made and obserued in the new church of England. Wherevpon Gregorie, sending backe the messengers, wrote an answere vnto all his demands. And first touching the conuersation of archbishops with the clergie, and in what sort the church goods ought to be imploied, he declared that the ancient custome of the apostolike see was to giue commandement vnto bishops ordeined, that the profits and reuenewes of 

<note place="marg">The reuenewes of the church to be diuided into 4. parts.</note>

 their benefices ought to be diuided into foure parts, whereof the first should be appointed to the bishop and his familic for the maintenance of hospitalitie: the second should be assigned to the clergie: the third giuen to the poore: and the fourth imploied vpon repairing of temples.</p>
<p>And whereas in the church of Rome one custome in saieng masse or the liturgie was 

<note place="marg">Liturgie.</note>

 obserued, and another custome in France; concerning such church seruice, Gregorie aduised 

<note place="marg">Church seruice.</note>

 <pb n="594"/>Austine that if he found anie thing either in the church of Rome, either in the church of France, or in anie other church which might most please the almightie God, he should diligentlie choose it out, and instruct the church of England (now being new) according to that forme which he should gather foorth of the said churches: for the things are not loued for 

<note place="marg">Such as did steale.</note>

 the places sake, but the places for the things sake. Also for punishing of such as had stolen things out of churches, so n*entity*ere as might be, the offendor should be chastised in charitie, so as he might know his fault, and (if it were possible) restore the thing taken away.</p>

<note place="marg">Marages.</note>

<p>And touching degr*entity*es in manage, Englishmen might take to their wiues, women that touched them in the third and fourth degr*entity*e without reprehension, and if any vnlawfull mariages were found amongst the Englishmen, as if the sonne had maried the fathers wife, or the brother the brothers wife, they ought to be warned in anie wise to absteine,, and vnderstand it to be a gr*entity*euous sinne: yet should they not for that thing be depriued of the communion of the bodie and bloud of our Lord, least those things might s*entity*eme to be punished in them wherein they had offended (before their conuersion to the christian faith) by 

<note place="marg">Discipline of the church.</note>

 ignorance: for at this season the church (saith he) correcteth some things of a feruent earnestnesse, suffreth some things of a gentle mildnes, and dissembleth some things of a prudent consideration, and so beareth and winketh at the same, that oftentimes the euill which she abhorreth by such bearing and dissembling, is restreined and reformed.</p>

<note place="marg">Ordeining of bishops.</note>

<p>Moreouer touching the ordeining of bishops, he would they should be so placed, that the distance of place might not be a let, but that when a bishop should be consecrated, there might be thr*entity*e or foure present. Also touching the bishops of France, he willed Augustine in no wise to intermeddle with them, otherwise than by exhortation and good admonition to be giuen, but not to presume anie thing by authorities sith the archbishop of Arles had receiued the pall in times past, whose authoritie he might not diminish, least he should s*entity*eme to put his sickle into another mans haruest. But as for the bishops of Britaine, he committed them vnto him, that the vnlearned might be taught, the weake with wholesome persuasions 

<note place="marg">Women with child.</note>

 strengthened, and the froward by authoritie reformed. Moreouer, that a woman with child might be baptised, and she that was deliuered after 33 daies of a manchild, and after 46 daies of a womanchild, should be purified, but yet might she enter the church before, if she would.</p>

<note place="marg">Matters in question about trifles.</note>

	  <p>The residue of Augustines demands consisted in these points, to wit:
<list type="ordered">
<item n="1"> Within what space a child should be christened after it was borne, for doubt to be preuented by death?</item>
<item n="2"> Within what time a man might companie with his wife after she was brought to bed?</item>
<item n="3"> Whether a woman, hauing hir floures, might enter the church, or receiue the communion?</item>
<item n="4"> Whether a man hauing had companie with his wife, mightenter the church, or receiue the communion before he was washed with water?</item>
<item n="5"> Whether after pollusion by night in dreames, a man might receiue the communion: or if he were a priest, whether he might say masse?</item>
	    </list></p>

<p>To these questions Gregorie maketh answere at full in the booke and place before cited, which for br*entity*efenesse we passe ouer. He sent also at that time with the messengers aforesaid, at their returne into England, diuers learned men to helpe Augustine in the haruest of 

<note place="marg">Assistance to Augustine. The pall.</note>

 the Lord. The names of the chiefest were these, Melitus, Iustus, Paulinus, and Ruffinianus. He sent allso the pall, which is the ornament of an archbishop, with vessels and apparell which should be vsed in churches by the archbishop and other ministers. He sent also with the pall other letters to Augustine, to let him vnderstand what number of bishops he would haue him to ordeine within this land. Also after that Melitus, and the other before mentioned persons were departed from Rome, he sent a letter vnto the same Melitus, being yet on his way toward Britaine, touching further matter concerning the churches of England, 

<note place="marg">Bearing with them that had newlie receiued the faith, whereof superstition grew and increased.</note>

 wherein he confesseth that manie things are permitted to be vsed of the people latelie brought from the errors of gentilitie, in keeping feasts on the dedication daies, which haue <pb n="595"/>resemblance with the old superstitious rites of the Pagan religion. For to hard and obstinate minds (saith he) it is not possible to cut away all things at once, for he that coueteth to the highest place, goeth vp by steps and not by leaps.</p>
<p>At the same time Gregorie did send letters vnto Augustine touching the miracles, which 

<note place="marg">Miracles</note>

 by report he vnderstood were shewed by the same Augustine, counselling him in no wise to glorie in the same, but rather in reioising to feare, and consider that God gaue him the gift to worke such signes for the wealth of them to whom he was sent to preach the gospell: he aduised him therefore to beware of vaine-glorie and presumption, for the disciples of the truth (saith he) haue no ioy, but onlie that which is common with all men, of which there is no end, for not euerie one that is elect worketh miracles, but euerie of the elect haue their names written in heauen. These letters, with the other which Gregorie sent at this time vnto Augustine, were dated the tenth day of the kalends of Iulie, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 602, which was the 19 yeere of the emperour Mauricius. Moreouer he sent most courteous 

<note place="marg"><date>602.</date></note>

 letters by these messengers to king Ethelbert, in the which he greatlie commended him, in that he had receiued the christian faith, and exhorted him to continue in that most holie state of life, whereby he might worthilie looke for reward at the hands of almightie God.</p>

<p>THUS farre we haue waded in the forme and maner of conuerting the English nation to christianitie, by the labours of Augustine and his coadiutors: now therefore (that we may orderlie proc*entity*ed) it remaineth that we say somewhat of the acts and deeds of the said Augustine: of whom we read, that after he was established archbishop, and had his s*entity*e appointed 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 him at Canturburie, he restored another church in that citie which had b*entity*ene erected there in times past by certeine of the Romans that were christilas, and did dedicate the same now to the honour of Christ our Sauiour. He also began the foundation of a monasterie without that citie, standing toward the east, in the which by his exhortation, king Ethelbert built a church euen from the ground, which was dedicated vnto the holie apostles Peter and Paule, in the which the bodie of the said Augustine was buried, and likewise the bodies of all the archbishops of Canturburie and kings of Kent a long time after. This abbie was called saint Austins after his name, one Peter being the first abbat thereof. The church 

<note place="marg">One Peter was the first Abbat.</note>

 there was not consecrated by Augustine, but by his successor Laurence, after he was dead.</p>
<p>Moreouer, king Ethelbert at the motion of Augustine built a church in the citie of London (which he latelie had conquered) and dedicated it vnto saint Paule; but whether he builded or restored this church of saint Paule it may be doubted, for there be diuers opinions of the building thereof. Some haue written that it was first builded by king Lud (as before is 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran, High.</emph></note>

 mentioned.) Other againe write, that it was builded afterward by Sigebert king of the Eastsaxons. Also king Ethelbert builded the church of saint Andrews in Rochester. It is likewise remembred by writers, that the same king Ethelbert procured a citizen of London 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

 to build a church to S. Peter without the citie of London toward the west, in a place then called Thorney, that is to say, the Ile of thorns, and now called Westminster: though others 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. High.</emph> Westminster church builded.</note>

 haue written that it was built by Lucius king of Britaine, or rather by Sibert king of the <pb n="596"/>Eastsaxons. This church was either newlie built, or greatlie inlarged by king Edward sutrnamed the Confessor, and after that, the third Hentle king of England did make there a beautifull monasterie, and verie richlie indowed the same with great possessions and sumptuous iewels. The place was ouergrowne with vnderwoods, as thornes and brambles, before that the church was begun to be builded there in this king Ethelberts daies. *entity* Thus the faith of Christ being once begun to be receiued of the English men, tooke woonderfull increase within a short time.</p>

<p>In the meane season by the helpe of king Ethelbert, Augustine caused a councell to be called at a place in the confines of the Westsaxons, which place long after was called Austines oke, where he procured the bishops or doctors of the prouinces of the Britains to come before him. Among the Britains or the Welshmen, christianitie as yet remained in force, which from the apostles time had neuer failed in that nation. When Augustine came into this land, he found in their prouinces seuen bishops s*entity*es, and an archbishops s*entity*e, wherein at verie godlie *entity* right religious prelats, and manie abbats, in the which the Lords flocke kept their right order but because they differed in obseruing the feast of Easter, and other 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 2. <emph>ca.</emph> 2.</note>

 rites from the vse of the Romane church, Augustine thought it necessarie to mooue them to agr*entity*e with him in vnitie of the same, but after long disputation and reasoning of those matters, they could not be induced to giue their assent in that behalfe. Augustine to prooue his opinion good, wrought a miracle in restoring sight to one of the Saxon nation that was blind.</p>
<p>The Britains that were present, mooued with this miracle, confessed that it was the right waie of iustice and righteousnesse which Augustine taught; but yet they said that they might not forsake their ancient customs without consent and licence of their nation. Wherevpon 

<note place="marg">Another synod.</note>

 they required another synod to be holden, whereat a greater number of them might be present. This being granted, there came (as it is reported) seuen bishops of the Britains, 

<note place="marg">The monasterie of Bangor. Abbat Dionoth.</note>

 and a great number of learned men, speciallie of the famous monasterie of Bangor, whereof in those daies one Dionoth was abbat, who as they went towards that councell, came first to a certeine wise man, which liued amongst them an heremits life, and asked his aduise, whether they ought to forsake their traditions at the preaching of Augustine or not: who made this answer; "If he be the man of God, follow him." Then said they; "How shall 

<note place="marg">The answer of a godlie man touching Austine the Englishmens apostle.</note>

 we prooue whether he be so or not?" Then said he: "The Lord saith, Take vp my yoke and learne of ne, for I am m*entity*eke *entity* humble in hart: if Augustine be humble and meeke in hart, it is to be bel*entity*eued that he also beareth the yoke of Christ, and offereth it to you to beare; but if he be not m*entity*eke but proud, it is certeine that he is not of GOD, nor his woord to be regarded." "And how shall we s*entity*e and perceiue that (said they?)" "Find meanes (said he) that he maie first come to the place of the synod with those of his side, and if he arise to receiue you at your comming, then know that he is the seruant of God, and obey him; but if he despise you, and arise not towards you, whereas you be more in number, let him be despised of you."</p>
<p>They did as he commanded, and it chanced, that when they came, they found Augustine sitting in his, chaire: whome when they beheld, straightwaies they conceiued indignation, and noting him of pride, laboured to reprooue all his saiengs. He told them that they vsed manie 

<note place="marg">Thr*entity*e things required by Augustine of the Britains to be obserued.</note>

 things contrarie to the custom of the vniuersall church, and yet if in thr*entity*e things they would obeie him, that is to say, in k*entity*eping the feast of Easter in due time, in ministring baptisme according to the custome of the Romane church, *entity* in preaching to the Englishmen the woord of life with him *entity* his fellowes, then would he be contented to suffer all other things patientlie which they did, though the same were contrarie to the maners and customs of the Romane iurisdiction. But they flatlie denied to doo anie of those things, and gaue a plaine answer that they would not receiue him for their archbishop: for laieng their heads togither, thus they thought, If he refuse now to arise vnto vs, how much the more will he contemne vs if we should become subiect to him? Vnto whom (as it is said) 

<note place="marg">Augustine threatneth.</note>

 Augustine in threatening wise told them afore hand, that if they would not receiue peace <pb n="597"/>with their brethren, they should receiue warre of the enimies; *entity* if they would not preach to the Englishmen the waie of life, they should suffer punishment by death at the hands of them: which thing in deed after came to passe, as in place conuenient shall be expressed. After this in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 604, the archbishop Augustine ordeined two bishops, 

<note place="marg">604.</note>

 that is to say, Melitus at London, that he might preach the woord of God to the Eastsaxons, 

<note place="marg">Bishops ordeined at London and Rochester.</note>

 which were diuided-from them of Kent by the riuer of Thames, and Iustus in the citie of Rochester within the limits of Kent.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AT</hi> that time Sabert reigned ouer the Eastsaxons, but he was subiect vnto Ethelbert king 

<note place="marg">SABERT.</note>

 of Kent, whose nephue he was also by his sister Ricula that was married vnto king Sledda that succ*entity*eded after Erchenwine the first king of the Eastsaxons, and begat on hir this Sabert that receiued the faith. After that Augustine had ordeined Melitus to be bishop of London, as before is said, king Ethelbert builded (as somle write) the church of saint Paule within the same citie, where the same Melitus and his successors might keepe their s*entity*e. And also for the like purpose he builded the church of saint Andrew the apostle at Rochester, that Iustus and his successors might haue their s*entity*e in that place, according to Augustines institution: he bestowed great gifts vpon both those churches, endowing them with lands and possessions verie bountifullie, to the vse of them that should be attendant in the same with the bishops.</p>
<p>Finallie, Augustine after he had gouerned as archbishop the church of Canturburie by 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Cestren.</emph></note>

 the space of 12 y*entity*eres currant, departed this life the fiue and twentieth of Maie, and was buried first without the citie n*entity*ere to the church of the apostles Peter and Paule (whereof mention is made before) bicause the same church as yet was not finished nor dedicated; but after it was dedicated, his bodie was brought into the church, and reuerentlie buried in the north Ile there. He ordeined in his life time Laurence to be his successor in the s*entity*e of Canturburie, of whome ye shall heare hereafter. *entity* Thus haue ye heard in what maner the Englishmen were first brought from the worshipping of false gods, and baptised in the name of the liuing God by the foresaid Augustine (as we find in Beda and other writers.) Now we will returne to other dooings chancing in the meane time amongst the people of this Ile.</p>

 Ceoloulph succ*entity*eded in gouernment of that kingdome, and reigned twelue y*entity*eres. He began his reigne (as should app*entity*ere by some writers) about the yeere of our Lord 597, and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith 607.</note>

 spent his time for the more part in warres, not giuing place to idlenesse, but s*entity*eking either to defend or inlarge the confines of his dominion. He was the sonne of Cutha, which was the sonne of Kenrike, which was the sonne of Certike. After Wibba or Wipha king of Mercia (who, nothing inferiour to his father, did not onelie defend his kingdome, but also <pb n="598"/>inlarge it, by subduing the Britains on ech side) one Ceorlus succ*entity*eded in that kingdome,

<note place="marg"><date>594.</date></note>

<p>Ye haue heard that Edelferd, which otherwise is called also by writers Edelfride, surnamed 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph> Edelferd.</note>

 the wild, gouerned still the Northumbers, which Edelferd did more damage to the Britains than anie one other king of the English nation. None of them destroied their countries more than he did: neither did anie prince make more of the Britains tributaries, or inhabited more of their countries with English people than he. H*entity*erevpon Edan king of those Scots which inhabited Britaine, being therewith mooued to see Edelfride prosper thus in his conquests, came against him with a mightie armie: but ioining in battell with Edelfride and his power, at a place called Degsastane, or Degsastone, or Deglaston, he lost the most part of his people, and with the residue that were left aliue, he escaped by flight. This was a sore foughten battell, with much bloudshed on both parties. For notwithstanding that the victorie remained with the Northumbers, Theobaldus the brother of Edelferd was slaine, with all that part of the English host which he gouerned: and it was fought in 

<note place="marg"><date>603.</date></note>

 the y*entity*ere of our Lord 603, in the 19 yeere of the reigne of the foresaid Edelferd, and in the sixt y*entity*ere of Ceowlfe king of the Westsaxons, and in the first y*entity*ere of the emperor 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt. Beda lib.</emph> 1. <emph>cap.</emph> 34.</note>

 Phocas, or rather in the last y*entity*ere of his predecessor Mauricius. From that day, till the daies of Beda, not one of the Scotish kings durst presume to enter into Britaine againe to 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph> S*entity*e in Scotland.</note>

 giue battell against the English nation, as Beda himselfe writeth. But the Scotish writers make other report of this matter, as in the historie of Scotland ye maie find recorded.</p>
<p>The Britains that dwelt about Chester, through their stoutnesse prouoked the aforesaid Edelferd king of the Northumbers vnto warre: wherevpon to tame their loftie stomachs, he assembled an armie *entity* came forward to besiege the citie of Chester, then called of the Britains 

<note place="marg">Chester as yet in possession of the Britains. <emph>I. Leland. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 Carleon ardour deu*entity*. The citizens coueting rather to suffer all things than a siege, and hauing a trust in their great multitude of people, came foorth to giue batell abroad in the fields, whome he compassing about with ambushes, got within his danger, and easilie discomfited.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph></note>

<p>It chanced that he had espied before the battell ioined (as Beda saith) where a great number of the British priests were got aside into a place somewhat out of danger, that they might there make their intercession to God for the good sp*entity*ed of their people, being then readie to giue battell to the Northumbers. Manie of them were of that famous monasterie 

<note place="marg">The number of moonks in the monasterie of Bangor.</note>

 of Bangor, in the which it is said, that there was such a number of moonks, that where they were diuided into seuen seuerall parts, with their seuerall gouernors appointed to haue rule ouer them, euerie of those parts conteined at the least thr*entity*e hundred persons, the which liued altogither by the labour of their hands. Manie therefore of those moonks hauing kept a solemne fast for thr*entity*e daies togither, were come to the armie with other to make 

<note place="marg">Brocmale.</note>

 praier, hauing for their defender one Brocmale or Broemael, earle (or consull as some call him) of Chester, which should preserue them (being giuen to praier) from the edge of the enimies swoord.</p>
<p>King Edelferd hauing (as is said) espied these men, asked what they were, and what their intent was; and being informed of the whole circumstance and cause of their being there, he said; "Then if they call to their God for his assistance against vs, suerlie though they beare no armour, yet doo they fight against vs, being busied in praier for our destruction." 

<note place="marg">The Britains discomfited *entity* slaine.</note>

 Wherevpon he commanded the first onset to be giuen them, and after slue downe the residue sidue of the British armie, not without great losse of his owne people. Of those moonks and priests which came to praie (as before is mentioned) there died at that battell about the number of 12 hundred, so that fiftie of them onelie escaped by flight. Brocmale, or Broemael at the first approch of the enimies, turning his backe with his companie, left them (whom he should haue defended) to be murthered through the enimies swoord. Thus was the prophesie of Augustine fulfilled, though he was long before departed this life (as Beda saith.)</p>

<pb n="599"/>
<p>*entity* H*entity*ere is to be noted, if this battell was fought in the seuenth y*entity*ere of Ceowlfe king 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt.</emph></note>

 of Westsaxon (as some haue written) and that Augustine liued 12 y*entity*eres after his entrance into the gouernment of the s*entity*e of Canturburie (as some write) it is euident that he liued foure y*entity*eres after this slaughter made of the British priests and moonks by Edelferd (as before is recited.) For Ceowlfe began his reigne (as before is mentioned) about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 596, and in the seuenth yeere of his reigne the battell was fought at Degsastane betwixt the English *entity* the Scots, which chanced in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 604, as Beda 

<note place="marg"><emph>W. Harison.</emph></note>

 himselfe recordeth. A late chronographer running vpon this matter, and preciselie setting downe his collection, saith that Athelbright, or Edelfride, K. of the Northumbers, *entity* Ethelbert K. of Kent, hauing Augustine in their companie, in the eight y*entity*ere after his arriuall, made warre vpon such Britains as refused to obserue the canons of the late councell mentioned 603, and killed 1200 moonks of the monasterie of Bangor, which laboured earnestlie, and in the sweat of their browes, thereby to get their liuings, *entity*c. Verelie Galf. Mon. writeth, that Ethelbert king of Kent (after he saw the Britains to disdaine and denie their subiection vnto Augustine, by whome he was conuerted to the christian faith) stirred vp Edelferd king of the Northumbers to warre against the Britains. But heereof Maister Fox 

<note place="marg"><emph>Acts and monuments. pag.</emph> 160.</note>

 doubteth, and therefore saith, that of vncerteine things he hath nothing certeinlie to saie, much lesse to iudge. But now to the matter where we left.</p>
<p>After that king Edelferd had made slaughter of the Britains (as before is rehearsed) he entred the citie of Chester, and from thence marched towards Bangor. The Britains in the 

<note place="marg">Blederike duke of Cornwall, Margadud king of Southwales, Cadwanek. of Northwales.</note>

 meane time had assembled their power vnder thr*entity*e capteins, that is to say, Blederike duke of Cornewall, Margadud king of Southwales, and Cadwane king of Northwales. These ioining in battell with Edelferd, slue 10066 of his souldiers, and constreined him to fl*entity*e out of the field for safegard of his life, after he had recciued manie wounds. On the part of the Britains the forsaid Blederike, which was chiefe capteine of the field in that battell, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Galf. Mon.</emph></note>

 chanced to be slaine. Thus saith Gal. Mon.</p>
<p>But the ancient writers of the English kings (as Beda, William Malmesburie, and Henrie Huntington, make no mention of this last battell and victorie obteined by the Britains in maner as aboue is expressed in Galfrids booke. But contrarilie we find, that Edelferd hauing such good successe in his businesse abroad as he could wish, vpon purpose to auoid danger at-home, banished Edwine the sonne of Alla or Elle, a yoong gentleman of great 

<note place="marg">Edwine the sonne of king Alla banished.</note>

 towardnesse, latelie come to the kingdome of the Northumbers by the death of his father. But this Edwine in time of his exile, being long tossed from place to place, and finding no stedfast friendship now in time of his aduersitie, at length came to Redwald, that was king at that time of the Eastangles, the third from Vffa, and successor to Titullus, which Titullus 

<note place="marg"><date>592.</date></note>

 did succ*entity*ed next after the said Vffa, the first king of Eastangles (as before is mentioned.) This Redwald did verie honourablie interteine Edwine, insomuch that Edelferd being informed 

<note place="marg">Edelferd.</note>

 thereof, was highlie displeased, and sent ambassadors vnto Redwald, to require him either to deliuer Edwine into his hands, or else if he refused so to doo, to declare and denounce vnto him open warres.</p>
<p>Redwald incouraged by his wife (that counselled him in no wise to betraie his friend, to whome he had giuen his faith, for the menaces of his enimie) assembled foorthwith an armie, and at the sudden comming vpon Edelferd, assaulted him yer he could haue time 

<note place="marg"><date>542.</date></note>

 to assemble his people togither. But yet the said Edelferd, though he was beset and brought 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 in danger at vnwares, died not vnreuenged: for putting himselfe in defense with such power as he could then get togither, he boldlie incountred the enimies, and giuing battell, slue Remerius the sonne of Redwald, and after was slaine himselfe, hauing reigned ouer the 

<note place="marg">Ethelferd slaine.</note>

 Northumbers about 22 y*entity*eres. This battell was fought n*entity*ere to the water of Idle.</p>
<p>The said Edelferd had issue by his wife Acca, the daughter of Alla, and sister to Edwine, two sonnes, Oswald being about two y*entity*eres of age, and Oswin about foure y*entity*eres, the which (their father being thus slaine) were by helpe of their gouernours conueied awaie

For when he had learned that the Scots there, in semblable wise as the Britains in their countrie, led not their liues in manie points according to the ecclesiasticall rules, as well in obseruing the feast of Easter contrarie to the vse of the Romane church, as in other things, he wrote vnto those Scots letters exhortatorie, requiring them most instantlie to an vnitie of catholike orders as might be agr*entity*eable with the church of Christ, spred and dispersed through the world.

<p>AFTER that the Britains had c*entity*tinued about the space almost of 24 y*entity*eres without anie one 

<note place="marg">CADWAN king of Britaine.</note>

 speciall gouernour, being led by sundrie rulers, euer sithens that Careticus was constreined to fl*entity*e ouer Seuerne, and fought oftentimes not onelie against the Saxons, but also one of them against another, at length in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 613, they assembled in the citie of Chester, 

<note place="marg"><date>613</date></note>

 and there elected Cadwan that before was ruler of Northwales, to haue the souereigne rule *entity* gouernement ouer all their nation, and so the said Cadwan began to reigne as king of Britaine in the said y*entity*ere 613. But some authors say, that this was in the y*entity*ere 609, in which y*entity*ere Careticus the British king departed this life. And then after his deceasse the Britains or Welshmen (whether we shall call them) chose Cadwan to gouerne them in the foresaid y*entity*ere 609, which was in the 7 y*entity*ere of the emperour Phocas, and the 21 of the second Lotharius king of France, and in the 13 y*entity*ere of Kilwoolfe king of the Westsaxons.</p>
<p>This Cadwan being established king, shortlie after assembled a power of Britains, and went against the foresaid Ethelfred king of Northumberland, who being thereof aduertised, did associate to him the most part of the Saxon princes, and came foorth with his armie to meet Cadwan in the field. Herevpon as they were readie to haue tried the matter by battell, certeine of their friends trauelled so betwixt them for peace, that in the end they brought them to agr*entity*ement, so that Ethelfred should k*entity*epe in quiet possession those his countries beyond 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gal. Mon.</emph></note>

 the riuer of Humber, and Cadwan should hold all that which of right belonged to the Britains <pb n="602"/>on the south side of the same riuer. This couenant with other touching their agr*entity*ement was confirmed with oths solemnelie taken, and pledges therewith deliuered, so that afterwards they continued in good and quiet peace, without vexing one an other.</p>
<p>What chanced afterward to Ethelfred, ye haue before heard rehersed, which for that it sonndeth more like to a truth than that which followeth in the British booke, we omit to make further rehersall, passing forward to other dooings which fell in the meane season, whilest this Cadwan had gouernement of the Britains, reigning as king ouer them the tearme 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Hard.</emph></note>

 of 22 or (as some say) but 13 y*entity*eres, and finallie was slaine by the Northumbers, as before hath b*entity*ene, and also after shall be shewed.</p>
<p>In the 8 y*entity*ere after that Cadwan began to reigne, Ethelbert king of Kent departed this life, in the 21 y*entity*ere after the comming of Augustine with his fellowes to preach the faith of Christ here in this realme: and after that Ethelbert had reigned ouer the prouince of Kent the tearme of 56 y*entity*eres (as Beda saith, but there are that haue noted thr*entity*e y*entity*ers lesse) he departed 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Beda li.</emph> 2 <emph>cap.</emph> 5.</note>

 this world, as aboue is signified, in the yeere of our Lord 617, on the 24 day of Februarie, and was buried in the Ile of saint Martine, within the church of the apostles Peter and Paule, without the citie of Canturburie, where his wife qu*entity*ene Bartha was also buried, and the foresaid archbishop Augustine that first conuerted him to the faith.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, this king Ethelbert with the aduise of his councell ordeined diuers lawes and statutes, according to the which decr*entity*es of iudgements should passe: those decr*entity*es he caused to be written in the English toong, which remained and were in force vnto the daies of Beda, as he declareth. And first it was expressed in those lawes, what amends he should make that stole anie thing that belonged to the church, to the bishop, or to anie ecclesiasticall person, willing by all means to defend them whose doctrine he had receiued.</p>

<note place="marg">EADBALD.</note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> the deceasse of Etthelbert, his sonne Eadbald succ*entity*eded in the gouernment of his kingdome of Kent, the which was a great hinderer of the increase of the new church amongst the Englishmen in those parties: for he did not onelie refuse to be baptised himselfe, but also vsed such kind of fornication, as hath not b*entity*ene heard (as the apostle saith) amongst the Gentiles, for he tooke to wife his mother in law, that had b*entity*ene wife to his father. By 

<note place="marg">The princes example occasion of euill.</note>

 which two euill examples, manie tooke occasion to returne to their heathenish religion, the which whilest his father reigned, either for the prince his pleasure, or for feare to offend him, did professe the christian faith. But Eadbald escaped not woorthie punishment to him sent from the liuing God for his euill deserts, insomuch that he was vexed with a certeine kind of madnesse, and taken with an vncleane spirit.</p>
<p>The foresaid storme or vnquiet troubling of the christian congregation, was afterwards greatlie increased also by the death of Sabert or Sebert king of the Eastsaxons, who was conuerted to the faith of Christ, and baptized by Melitus bishop of London (as before is mentioned) *entity* departing this life to go to a better in the blissefull kingdome of heauen, he left behind him thr*entity*e sonnes as true successours in the estate of his earthlie kingdome, which 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Cest. Bedali.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 5. Serred, Seward, and Sigebert, the sonnes of Sabert.</note>

 sonnes likewise refused to be baptised. Their names were Serred, Seward, *entity* Sigebert, men of an ill mind, *entity* such as in whome no vertue remained, no feare of God, nor anie respect of religion, but speciallie hating the professours of the christian faith. For after their father was dead, they began to fall to their old idolatrie, which in his life time they s*entity*emed to haue giuen ouer, insomuch that now they openlie worshipped idols, and gaue libertie to their subiects to do the like.</p>
<p>And when the bishop Melitus, at the solemnizing of masse in the church, distributed the eucharisticall bread vnto the people, they asked him (as it is said) wherfore he did not deliuer of that bright white bread vnto them also, as well as he had b*entity*ene accustomed to doo to their father Saba (for so they vsed to call him.) Vnto whome the bishop made this answer: "If you will be washed in that wholesome fountaine, wherein your father was washed, ye may <pb n="603"/>be partakers of that holie bread whereof he was partaker, but if you despise the washpoole of life, ye may by no meanes tast the bread of saluation." But they offended herewith, replied in this wise: "We will not enter into that fountaine, for we know we haue no n*entity*ed thereof; but yet neuerthelesse we will be refreshed with that bread."</p>
<p>After this, when they had beene earnestlie and manie times told, that vnlesse they would be baptised, they might not be partakers of the sacred oblation; at length in great displeasure they told him, that if he would not consent vnto them in so small a matter, there should be no place for him within the bounds of their dominion, and so he was constrained to depart. Wherevpon he being expelled, resorted into Kent, there to take aduise with his fellow-bishops, Laurence and Iustus, what was to be doone in this so weightie a matter. Who finallie resolued vpon this point, that it should be better for them to returne into their countrie, where with fr*entity*e minds they might serue almightie God, rather than to remaine amongest people that rebelled against the faith, without hope to doo good amongest them. Wherefore Melitus and Iustus did depart first, and went ouer into France, minding there to abide till they might s*entity*e what the end would be. But shortlie after, those brethren the kings of Essex, which had expelled their bishop in maner aboue said, suffered woorthilie for their wicked dooings. For going forth to battell against the Westsaxons, they were ouerthrowen 

<note place="marg">The sonne of king Sebert slaine.</note>

 and slaine altogither with all their armie, by the two kings Kinigils and Quichelme, But neuerthelesse, albeit the authors of the mischiefe were thus taken awaie, yet the people that countrie would not be reduced againe from their diuelish woorshipping of false gods, being eftsoones fallen thereto in that season by the incouragement and perilous example of their rulers. Wherefore the archbishop Laurence was in mind also to follow his fellowes Melitus and Iustus: but when he minded to set forward, he was warned in a dreame, and cruellie scourged (as hath b*entity*ene reported by the apostle saint Peter, who reprooued him) for that he would so vncharitablie forsake his flocke, *entity* leaue it in danger without a shepherd to k*entity*epe the woolfe from the fold.</p>
<p>The archbishop imboldned by this vision, and also repenting him of his determination, came to king Eadbald, and shewed to him his stripes, and the maner of his dreame. The king being herewith put in great feare, renounced his heathenish worshipping of idols, and was baptised, and as much as in him laie, from thenceforth succoured the congregation of the christians, and aduanced the church to his power. He sent also into France, and called home the bishops Melitus and Iustus, so that Iustus was restored to his s*entity*e of Rochester.</p>
<p>But the Eastsaxons would not receiue Melitus to his s*entity*e at London, but continued in their wicked mawmetrie, in obeieng a bishop of their pagan law, whom they had erected for that purpose. Neither was king Eadbald of that authoritie and power in those parties, as his father was before, whereby he might constreine them to receiue their lawfull bishop. But suerlie the said king Eadbald with his people, after he was once conuerted againe, gaue himselfe wholie to obeie the lawes of GOD, and amongt other d*entity*eds of godlie zeale, he builded a church to our ladie at Canturburie, within the monasterie of saint Peter, afterwards called 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 2.</note>

 saint Agnes. This church was consecrated by Melitus, who after the death of Laurence succ*entity*eded in gouernance of the archbishops s*entity*e of Canturburie. After Melitus, who departed this life in the yeare of our Lord 624, Iustus that before was bishop of Rochester, was made 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>ca.</emph> 8.</note>

 archbishop of Canturburie, and ordeined one Romanus to the s*entity*e of Rochester. About that time, the people of the north parts beyond Humber receiued the faith, by occasion (as after shall app*entity*ere.)</p>

<p>YE haue heard how Edelfred the king of Northumberland was slaine in battell neere to the water of Idel by Redwald king of the Eastangles, in fauour of Edwin whom the said Edelfred had confined out of his dominion, 24 y*entity*eres before. The foresaid Redwald therefore hauing obteined that victorie, found meanes to place Edwin in gouernement of that kingdome of the Northumbers, hauing a title thereto as sonne to Alla or Elle, sometime 

<note place="marg">EDWIN. <emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>ca.</emph> 5.</note>

 king of Northumberland. This Edwin prooued a right valiant prince, *entity* grew to be of more power than anie other king in the daies of the English nation: not onelie ruling ouer a great part of the countries inhabited with English men, but also with Britains, who inhabited not onelie in Wales, but in part of Chesshire, Lancashire, Cumberland, and alongst by the west sea-coast in Galloway, and so foorth euen vnto Dunbritaine in Scotland: which I haue thought good to note, that it may appeare in what countries Cadwallo bare rule, of whome so often mention is made in this part of the historie. But as concerning Edwin, his reputation was such, as not onelie the English men, Britains and Scots, but also the Iles of 

<note place="marg"><emph>W. Malm.</emph> taketh Meuania to be Anglesey.</note>

 Orknie, and those of Man, and others the west Iles of ancient time called Meuaniae, had him in reuerence, and feared his mightie power, so as they durst not attempt anie exploit to offend him.</p>
<p>It chanced that shortlie after, king Redwald had aduanced him to the kingdom of Northumberland, to wit, about 6 yeares, the same Redwald deceassed, which made greatlie for the more augmentation of Edwins power. For the people of the Eastangles, which (whilest Edwin remained amongst them as a banished man) had conceiued a good opinion of him for his approoued valiancie and noble courage, offered themselues to be wholie at his commandement. 

<note place="marg">Carpwaldus.</note>

 But Edwin suffering Carpwald or Erpwald the sonne of Redwald to inioie the bare title and name of the king of that countrie, ruled all things at his owne will and pleasure. Neither was there anie prouince within Britaine that did not obeie him, or was not readie to doo him seruice (the kingdome of Kent onelie excepted) for he suffered the Kentishmen to liue in quiet, because he began to haue a liking to the sister of king Eadbald, namelie the ladie Ethelburga, otherwise called Tate or Tace.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 9.</note>

<p>He made request therefore by sending ambassadours to hir brother, to haue the said ladie in marriage, and at length obteined hir, with condition that she being a christian woman, might not onelie vse the christian religion, but also that all those, whether men or women, priests or ministers, which came with hir, might haue licence to doo the same, without trouble or impeachment of anie maner of person. Herevpon she being sent vnto him, there was appointed 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West. Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 9.</note>

 to go with hir (besides manie other) one Pauline, which was consecrated bishop by the archbishop Iustus the 21 of Iulie, in the yeare of our Lord 625, who at his comming into 

<note place="marg"><date>625.</date></note>

 Northumberland thus in companie with Ethelburga, trauelled earnestlie in his office, both to preserue hir and such christians in the faith of Christ, as were appointed to giue their attendance on hir, least they should chance to fall: and also sought to win some of the Pagans (if it were possible) vnto the same faith, though at the first he little profited in that matter.</p>
<p>In the yeare following, there came a murtherer vnto the court of king Edwin, as then soiourning in a palace which stood vpon the side of the riuer of Dorwent, being sent from <pb n="605"/>Quichelme king of the Westsaxons, to the intent to murther Edwin, because he had of late sore damnified the countries of the Westsaxons. This murtherer was called Eumerus, *entity* caried vnder his coate a shost double edged woodknife inuenomed of purpose, that if the 

<note place="marg">Other say an axe, as <emph>Matth. West.</emph> Eumerus.</note>

 king being but a little hurt therewith, should not die of the wound, yet he should not escape the danger of the poison. This Eumerus on Easter mondaie came to the king, and making foorth to him as it had b*entity*ene to haue declared some message from his maister, when he had espied his time, drew his weapon, and offered to strike the king. But one of the kings seruants named Lilla, perceiuing this, stept betwixt the king and the blow. Howbeit the murtherer set the stripe forward with such force, that the knife running through the bodie of Lilla wounded also the king a little: and before this murtherer could be beaten downe, he slue another of the kings seruants, a knight that attended vpon him, called Fordher.</p>
<p>The same night Ethelburga was deliuered of a daughter named Eaufled, for the which 

<note place="marg">Eaufled borne.</note>

 when king Edwin gaue thanks vnto his gods, in the presence of bishop Pauline, the bishop did admonish him, rather to giue thanks vnto the true and onelie God, by whose goodnesse it came to passe that the queene was safelie and without danger deliuered. The king giuing good eare vnto the bishops wholesome admonition, promised at that present to become a christian, if he might reuenge his iniuries receiued at the hands of the Westsaxons. And to assure Pauline that his promise should take place, he gaue vnto him his new borne daughter to be made holie to the Lord, that is to say, baptised. The bishop receiuing hir, on Whitsundaie next following baptised hir, with twelue other of the kings houshold, she being the first of the English Northumbers that was so washed in the founteine of regeneration.</p>
<p>In the meane time K. Edwin being recouered of his hurt, assembled an armie, and went against the Westsaxons, with whome incountring in battell, he either slue or brought to his subiection all them that had conspired his death, and so returned as a conquerour into his countrie. But yet he delaied time in performance of his promise to become a christian: howbeit he had left his dooing of sacrifice to idols, euer since he made promise to be baptised. He was a sage prince, and before he would alter his religion, he politikelie thought good to heare matters touching both his old religion, and the christian religion throughlie examined.</p>
<p>Now whilest he thus hoong in doubt vnto whether part he should incline, there came letters to him from pope Boniface the fift of that name, exhorting him by sundrie kinds of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 10.</note>

 gentle perswasions, to turne to the worshipping of the true and liuing God, and to renounce the worshipping of mawmets and idols. The pope wrote also to qu*entity*ene Ethelburga, praieng hir to continue in hir good purpose, and by all meanes possible to doo what might be doone 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 11.</note>

 for the conuerting of hir husband vnto the faith of Christ. But the thing that most mooued the king, was a vision which sometime he had while he remained as a banished man in the 

<note place="marg">A vision.</note>

 court of Redwald king of the Eastangles, as thus.</p>
<p>After that king Ethelfred was informed that the foresaid Redwald had receiued Edwin, he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda. cap.</emph> 12.</note>

 ceased not by his ambassadours to moue Redwald either to deliuer Edwin into his hands, or to make him awaie. At length by often sending, *entity* promises made of large summes of monie, mixed with threatnings, he obteined a grant of his sute, so that it was determined that Edwin should either be murthered, or else deliuered into his enimies hands. One of Edwins friends hauing intelligence hereof, in the night season came to Edwins chamber, and leading him abroad, told him the whole practise, and what was purposed against him, offering to helpe him out of the countrie, if he would so aduenture to escape. Edwin being 

<note place="marg">The honorable consideration of Edwin.</note>

 woonderouslie amazed, thanked his friend, but refused to depart the countrie, sith he had no iust cause outwardlie giuen to play such a slipper part, choosing rather to ieopard his life with honour, than to giue men cause to thinke that he had first broken promise with such a prince as Redwald was, to whome he had giuen his faith.</p>
<p>Herevpon his friend departing from him, left him sitting without the doores: where after he had reuolued manie things in his mind, and thought long vpon this matter, at length he <pb n="606"/>perceiued one to come towards him vnknowne, and in strange apparell, s*entity*eming to him in euerie point a stranger, at which sight (for that he could not imagine who it should be) Edwin was much afraid: but the man comming to him saluted him, and asked of him what he made there at that time of the night when other were at rest. Edwin on the other part asked what he had to doo therewith, and whether he vsed to lie abroad in the night, or within house? Who answering said; Thinke not Edwin that I am ignorant of thy heauinesse, of thy watchings, and this thy solitarie sitting here without doores. For I know who thou art, wherefore thou art thus pensiue, and what euils thou fearest to be towards th*entity*e at hand. But tell me, what wouldest thou giue him, that could deliuer th*entity*e out of this heauinesse, and perswade Redwald that he should neither doo th*entity*e hurt, nor deliuer th*entity*e to thine enimies? Here with when Edwin said that he would gladlie giue all that in him might lie to such a one in reward: The other said; What wouldst thou giue then, if he should promise in good sooth that (all thine enimies being destroied) thou shouldest be king, and that thou shouldest passe in power all the kings which haue reigned in the English nation before thy time? Edwin being better come to himselfe by such demandes, did not sticke to promise that he would requite his friendship with woorthie thanks.</p>
<p>Then replied he to his words and said; If he that shall prophesie to th*entity*e this good hap to come, shall also be able to informe thee in such counsell for thy health and life, as neuer anie of thy forefathers or kinsfolke yet haue heard, wouldest thou obey him, and also consent to receiue his wholesome aduertisement? Wherevnto without further deliberation Edwin promised, that he would in all points follow the instruction of him that should deliuer him out of so manie and great calamities, and bring him to the rule of a kingdome. Which answere being got, this person that thus talked with him, laid his hand vpon his head, saieng: When this therefore shall chance to th*entity*e, be not forgetfull of this time, nor of this communication, and those things that thou now dooest promise, s*entity*e thou performe. And there-with he vanished awaie. So that Edwin might well perceiue it was no man but a vision that thus had appeared vnto him.</p>
<p>[*entity* This vnaccustomed course it pleased God to vse for the conuersion of the king (to whose example it was no doubt but the people and inferiour sort would generallie be conformed) who otherwise had continued in paganisme and blind ignorance both of Gods truth and true christianitie. And it maie be that there was in him, as in other kings his predecessors, a settled perswasion in gentilish error, so that neither by admonition nor preaching (though the same had proc*entity*eded from the mouth of one allotted to that ministerie) he was to be reuoked from the infidelitie and misbel*entity*efe wherein he was nuzzeled and trained vp. For it is the nature of all men, to be addicted to the obseruation of such rites and customes as haue b*entity*ene established and left in force by their progenitors, and sooner to stand vnto a desire and earnest purpose of adding somewhat to their elders corrupt constitutions, and irreligious course of conuersation, than to be inclinable to anie article or point tending to innouation: so inflexible is the posteritie to swarue from the traditions of antiquitie, stand the same vpon neuer so grosse and palpable absurdities.]</p>
<p>Edwin still reioising in the foresaid comfortable talke, but thoughtfull in mind what he should be, or from whence he came that had talked in this sort with him; behold his friend returned that first had brought him foorth of his chamber, and declared vnto him good newes, how the king by perswasion of the qu*entity*ene had altered his determination, and minded to mainteine his quarell to the vttermost of his power: and so he did in d*entity*ed. For with all diligence he raised an armie, and went against Ethelfrid, vanquished him in battell, and placed Edwin in the kingdome (as before ye haue heard.)</p>

<head type="unitnum">The Xxvi. Chapter.</head>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING the former vision, king Edwin deferred time yer he would receiue the christian faith, in somuch that Pauline vpon a daie came vnto him as he sat musing what he were best to doo, and laid his hand vpon his head, asking him if he knew that signe. Whereat when the king would haue fallen downe at his f*entity*et, he lifted him vp, and as it were in familiar wise thus said vnto him: "Behold, by the assistance of Gods fauour thou hast escaped the hands of thine enimies, whome thou stoodst in feare of: behold through his bountious liberalitie, thou hast obteined the kingdome which thou diddest desire, remember then that thou delaie no time to performe third thing that thou diddest promise, in receiuing his faith, and k*entity*eping his commandements, which deliuering th*entity*e from worldlie aduersities, hath thus aduanced th*entity*e to the honor of a king: and if from henceforth thou wilt obey his will, which by my mouth h*entity*e setteth and preacheth to th*entity*e and others, he will deliuer th*entity*e from euerlasting torments, and make th*entity*e partaker with him in his celestiall kingdome." It is to be thought that the vision which the king had in times past receiued, was in spirit reuealed vnto Pauline, wherevpon without delaie of time, he put him in remembrance of it in maner as aboue is mentioned.</p>
<p>The king hauing heard his words, answered, that he would and ought to receiue the faith which he taught, but first he would conferre with his nobles, and if they would agr*entity*e to doo the like, then would they be baptised altogither at one time. Pauline satisfied herewith, Edwin did as he had promised, calling togither the wisest men of his realme, and of 

<note place="marg">Edwin consuneth with his nobles. The answere to an heathen bishop.</note>

 them asked the question what they thought of this diuinitie, which was preached vnto them by Pauline, vnto whome his chiefe bishop named Coifi, incontinentlie made this answer; that Suerlie the religion which they had hitherto followed was nothing worth. "For saith he, there is none of thy people that hath more reuerentlie woorshipped our gods than I haue doone, and yet be there manie that haue receiued far greater benefits at thy hands than I haue doone: and therefore if our gods were of anie power, then would they rather helpe me to high honor and dignitie than others. Therefore if it maie be found that this new religion is better *entity* more auailable than our old, let vs with sp*entity*ed imbrace the same."</p>
<p>Finallie, when other of the kings councell *entity* men of high authoritie gaue their consents, that this doctrine which Pauline taught ought to be receiued, if therein appeered more certeintie of saluation than could be found in the other; at length the king gaue licence to Pauline openlie to preach the gospell, and renouncing his worshipping of false gods, professed 

<note place="marg">Pauline licer ced to preac the gospell.</note>

 the christian faith. And when he demanded of his bishop Coifi who should first deface the altars of their idols, and the tabernacles wherewith they were compassed about? <pb n="608"/>He answered, that himselfe would doo it. For what is more m*entity*et (saith he) than that I, which thorough foolishnesse haue worshipped them, should now for example sake destroie the same, thorough wisedome giuen me from the true and liuing God?" And streightwaies throwing awaie the superstition of vanitie, required armour and weapon of the king, with a stoned horsse, vpon the which he being mounted, rode foorth to destroie the idols.</p>
<p>This was a strange sight to the people: for it was not lawfull for the bishop of their law to put on armour, or to ride on anie beast, except it were a mare. He hauing therefore a swoord gird to him, tooke a speare in his hand, and riding on the kings horsse, went to the place where the idols stood. The common people that beheld him had thought he had b*entity*ene starke mad, and out of his wits: but he without longer deliberation, incontinentlie vpon his comming to the temple, began to deface the same, and in contempt threw his speare against it, *entity* reioising greatlie in the knowledge of the worshipping of the true God, commanded his companie to destroie *entity* burne downe the same temple with all the altars. This place where the idols were sometime worshipped was not farre from Yorke, towards the east part of the riuer of Derwent, and is called Gotmundin Gaham, where the foresaid bishop by the inspiration of God defaced and destroied those altars, which he himselfe had hallowed.</p>

<note place="marg">King Edwin with his people receiue the christian faith. <emph>Beda. lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 14.</note>

<p>King Edwin therefore with all the nobilitie, and a great number of his people, receiued the faith and were baptised, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 627, in the tenth y*entity*ere of his reigne, and about the 178 y*entity*ere after the first comming of the Englishmen into this land. He was baptised at Yorke on Easter daie (which fell that y*entity*ere the day before the Ides of Aprill) 

<note place="marg"><date>627.</date></note>

 in the church of S. Peter the apostle, which he had caused to be erected and built vp of timber vpon the sudden for that purpose, and afterwards began the foundation of the same church in stone-woorke of a larger compasse, comprehending within it that oratorie which he had first caused to be built: but before he could finish the woorke, he was slaine (as after shall be shewed) leauing it to be performed of his successor Oswald.</p>
<p>Pauline continued from thencefoorth during the kings life, which was six y*entity*eres after, in preaching the gospell in that prouince, conuerting an innumerable number of people to the faith of Christ, among whom were Osfride and Eadfride the two sonnes of Edwin, whom he begot in time of his banishment of his wife Quinburga, the daughter of Cearlus king of Mercia. Also afterwards he begot children on his second wife Ethelburga, that is to say, a 

<note place="marg">Ediltrudis.</note>

 sonne called Edilhimus, and a daughter named Ediltrudis, and aother sonne called Bustfrea, of the which the two first died in their cradels, and were buried in the church at Yorke. To be briefe: by the kings assistance *entity* fauour shewed vnto Pauline in the woorke of the Lord, great multitudes of people dailie receiued the faith, and were baptised of Pauline in manie places, but speciallie in the riuer of Gleuie within the prouince of Bernicia, and also in Swale in the prouince of Deira: for as yet in the beginning thus of the church in those countries, no temples or fonts could be builded or erected in so short a time.</p>
<p>Of such great zeale was Edwin (as it is reported) towards the setting foorth of Gods truth, 

<note place="marg">This chanced in the y*entity*ere 632, as <emph>Matt. West.</emph> saith. Redwald king of Eastangles baptised.</note>

 that he persuaded Carpwald the sonne of Redwald king of the Eastangles to abandon the superstitious worshipping of idols, and to receiue the faith of Christ with all his whole prouince. His father Redwald was baptised in Kent long before this time, but in vaine: for returning home, through counsell of his wife and other wicked persons, he was seduced, and being turned from the sincere puritie of faith, his last dooings were woorse than his first, 

<note place="marg">Redwald would serue God and the diuell.</note>

 so that according to the maner of the old Samaritans, he would s*entity*eme both to serue the true God and his false gods, (whom before time he had serued) and in one selfe church had at one time both the sacraments of Christ ministred at one altar, and sacrifice made vnto diuels at another.</p>
<p>But Carpwald within a while after he had receiued the faith, was slaine by one of his owne countrimen that was an ethnike, called Richbert, and then after his death, that prouince 

<note place="marg">Sibert or Sigibert.</note>

 for the tearme of thr*entity*e yeeres was wrapped eftsoones in errour, till Sibert or Sigibert, the brother of Carpwald, a most christian prince, and verie well learned, obteined the rule of that kingdome, who whilest he liued a banished man in France during his brothers <pb n="609"/>life time, was baptised there, and became a christian: and when he came to be king, he caused all his prouince to be partaker of the same fountaine of life, wherein he had beene dipped himselfe.</p>
<p>Vnto this godlie purpose also, a bishop of the parties of Burgoigne named Felix was a great furtherer, who comming ouer vnto the archbishop of Canturburie Honorius that was successor vnto Iustus, and declaring vnto him his earnest desire, was sent by the same archbishop to preach the woord of life vnto the Eastangles, which he did with such good successe, that he conuerted the whole countrie to the faith of Iesus Christ, and placed the s*entity*e of his

 bishoprike at Dunwich, ending the course of his life there in peace after he had continued in that his bishoplike office the space of 17 y*entity*eres. Moreouer Pauline, after that he had conuerted the Northumbers, preached the woord of God vnto them of Lindsey, which is a part of Lincolnshire: and first he persuaded one Blecca the gouernour of the citie of Lincolne 

<note place="marg">This chanced in the y*entity*ere 628, as <emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith.</note>

 to turne vnto Christ, togither with all his familie. In that citie he also builded a church of stone woorke. Thus Pauline trauelled in the woorke of the Lord, the same being greatlie furthered by the helpe of Edwin, in whose presence he baptised a great number of people in the riuer of Trent, n*entity*ere to a towne, which in the old English toong was called <emph>Tio vulfingacester.</emph> This Pauline had with him a deacon named lames, the which shewed himselfe verie diligent in the ministerie, and profited greatlie therein.</p>
<p>But now to returne to king Edwin, who was a prince verelie of woorthie fame, and for the politike ordering of his countries and obseruing of iustice, deserued highlie to be commended: for in his time all robbers by the high waie were so banished out of his dominions, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 that a woman with hir new borne child alone, without other companie, might haue trauelled from sea to sea, and not haue incountred with anie creature that durst once haue offered hir iniurie. He was also verie carefull for the aduancement of the commoditie *entity* common wealth 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West. Beda lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 16.</note>

 of his people, insomuch that where there were any sw*entity*et and cleare water-springs, he caused postes to be set vp, and iron dishes to be fastened thereto with chaines, that waifaring men might haue the same readie at hand to drinke with: and there was none so hardie as to touch the same but for that vse. He vsed wheresoeuer he went within the cities or elsewhere abroad, to haue a banner borne before him, in token of iustice to be ministred by his roiall authorities.</p>
<p>In the meane season, pope Honorius the fift, hearing that the Northumbers had receiued the faith (as before is mentioned) at the preaching of Pauline, sent vnto the said Pauline the pall, confirming him archbishop in the s*entity*e of Yorke. He sent also letters of exhortation 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 2. <emph>cap.</emph> 17.</note>

 vnto king Edwin, to kindle him the more with fatherlie aduise to continue and proc*entity*ed in the waie of vnderstanding, into the which he was entered. At the same time also, bicause Iustus the archbishop of Canturburie was dead, and one Honorius elected to that s*entity*e, pope Honorius sent to the said elect archbishop of Canturburie his pall, with letters, wherein was conteined a decr*entity*e by him made, that when either the archbishop of Canturburie or

The copie of which letter is registred in the ecclesiasticall historie of Beda, bearing date the third Ides of Iune, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 633. The same pope sent letters also to the Scotish people, exhorting them to celebrate

<note place="marg">The feast of Easter. The heresie of the Pelagians.</note>

 And also bicause the heresie of the Pelagians began to renew againe amongst them (as he was informed) he admonished them to beware thereof, and by all meanes to auoid it. For he knew that to the office of a pastor it is necessarilie incident, not onelie to exhort, teach, and shew his sheepe the waies to a christian life, but also stronglie to withstand all such vniust meanes, as might hinder their proc*entity*eding in the truth of religion. For as poison is vnto the bodie, that is heresie vnto veritie.

<p>But now that the kingdome of Northumberland flourished (as before is partlie touched) in happie state vnder the prosperous reigne of Edwin, at length, after he had gouerned it the

 Penda king of Mercia enuieng the prosperous proc*entity*edings of Edwin, procured Cadwallo to mooue this rebellion against Edwin: and ioining his power with Cadwallo, they inuaded the countrie of Northumberland iointlie togither. Edwin heereof aduertised, gathered his people, *entity* came to incounter them, so that both armies met at a place called Hatfield, where

Also there was slaine on Edwins part, Eodbald king of Orkenie. Moreouer there was an other of Edwins sonnes named Eadfride constreined of necessitie to giue himselfe into the hands of Penda, and was after by him cruellie put to death, contrarie to his promised faith in king Oswalds dales that succ*entity*eded Edwin. Thus did king Edwin end his life in that battell, fought at Hatfield aforesaid, on the fourth ides of October, in the yere of our Lord 633, he being then about the age of 47 y*entity*eres and vpwards.</p>

 which latelie was begun amongst the Northumbers, made hauocke in all places where they came, not sparing man, woman nor child: and so continued in their furious outrage a long time in passing through the countrie, to the great decay and calamitie of the christian congregations in those parties. And still the christian Britains were lesse mercifull than Penda his heathenish souldiers. For euen vnto the daies of Beda (as he affirmeth) the Britains made no account of the faith or religion of the Englishmen, nor would communicate with them more than with the pagans, bicause they differed in rites from their accustomed traditions.</p>

<note place="marg">The archbishop Pauline flieth into Kent.</note>

<p>When the countrie of the Northumbers was brought into this miserable case by the enimies inuasion, the archbishop Pauline taking with him the qu*entity*ene Ethelburga, whom he had brought thither, returned now againe with hir by water into Kent, where he was honorablie <pb n="611"/>receiued of the archbishop Honorius, and king Eadbald. He came thither in the conduct of one Bassus a valiant man of warre, hauing with him Eaufred the daughter, and Vulfr*entity*a the sonne of Edwin, *entity* also Iffi the sonne of Osfride Edwins sonne, whom their mother after for feare of the kings Edbold and Oswold did send into France where they died. The church of Rochester at that time was destitute of a bishop, by the death of Romanus, who being sent to Rome vnto pope Honorius, was drowned by the way in the Italian seas. Wherevpon at the request of archbishop Honorius, and king Eadbald, Pauline tooke vpon him the charge of that s*entity*e, and held it till he died.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">AFTER</hi> it was knomne that Edwin was slaine in battell (as before ye haue heard) Osrike

 the sonne of his vncle Elfrike tooke vpon him the rule of the kingdome of Deira, which had receiued the sacrament of baptisme by the preaching and vertuous instruction of Pauline. But the other kingdome of Northumberland called Bernicia, Eaufride the son of Edelferd 

<note place="marg">Eaufrid king of Dernicia.</note>

 or Edelfride, tooke vpon him to gouerne. This Eaufride during the time of Edwins reigne, had continued in Scotland, and there being conuerted to the christian faith was baptised. But both these princes, after they had obteined possession of their earthlie kingdoms, did forget the care of the heauenlie kingdome, so that they returned to their old kind of idolatrie. But almightie God did not long suffer this their vnthankefuinesse without iust punishment: for first in the next summer, when Osrike had rashlie besieged Cadwallo king of the Britains, within a certeine towne, Cadwallo brake foorth vpon him, and finding him vnprouided to make resistance, slue him with all his armie. Now after this, whilest Cadwallo not like a

 conqueror gouerned the prouinces of the Northumbers, but like a tyrant wasted and destroied them, in sleaing the people in tragicall maner, he also slue Eaufride, the which with twelue men of warre came vndiscr*entity*etlie vnto him to sue for peace: and thus within lesse than twelue moneths space both these runagate kings were dispatched.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">THEN</hi> Oswald the sonne of Edelfred, and brother to the foresaid Eaufride was created king

 of the Northumbers, the sixt in number from Ida. This Oswald after that his father was slaine, lined as a banished person a long time within Scotiand, where he was baptised, and professed the christian religion, and passed the flower of his youth in good exercises, both of mind *entity* bodie. Amongst other things he practised the vnderstanding of warlike knowledge, minding so to vse it as it might stand him in stead to defend himselfe from iniurie of the enimies that should prouoke him, and not otherwise. Herevp*entity* Cadwallo king of the Britains made in maner no account of him: for by reason that he had atchiued such great victories against the Englishmen, and hauing slaine their two kings (as before is expressed) he ceassed not to proceed in his tyrannicall dooings, reputing the English people for slouthfull, and not apt to the warre, boasting that he was borne to their destruction. Thus being set vp in pride of courage, he feared no perils, but boldlie (without considering at all the skilfull knowledge which Oswald had sufficientlie learned in feates of war) tooke vpon him to assaile the foresaid Oswald, that had brought an armie against him, and was encamped in a plaine field n*entity*ere vnto the wall which the Romans had builded in times past against the inuasion of Scots and Picts.</p>
<p>Cadwallo streight prouoked Oswald to trie the matter by battell, but Oswald forbare the first day, and caused a crosse to be erected in the same place where he was incamped, in full hope that it should be an ensigne or trophie of his victorie, causing all souldiers to make their praiers to God, that in time of such necessitie it might please him to succour them that worship him. It is said, that the crosse being made, and the hole digged wherein it should be set, he tooke the crosse in his owne hands, and putting the foot thereof into that hole, so held it till his souldiers had filled the hole, and rammed it vp: and then caused all the souldiers to kn*entity*ele downe vpon their kn*entity*es, and to make intercession to the true and liuing God for his assistance against the proud enimie, with whom they should fight in a iust quarell for the preseruation of their people and countrie.</p>

<pb n="612"/>
<p>After this, on the next morning he boldlie gaue battell to his enimies, so that a sore and cruell fight insued betwixt them. At length Oswald perceiued that the Britains began somwhat to faint, and therfore caused his people to renew their force, and more lustilie to preasse forward, so that first he put that most cruell enimie to flight, and after pursuing the chase

 ouertooke him, and slue him with the most part of all his huge and mightie armie, at a place called Denisborne, but the place where he caused the crosse to be erected he named Heuenfield. Thus Cadwallo the most cruell enimie of the English name ended his life: he was terrible both in nature and countenance, for the which cause they say the Britains did afterwards set vp his image, that the same might be a terror to the enimies when they should behold it.</p>
<p>*entity* But here is to be remembred by the British historie of Gal. Mon. it should appeare that Cadwallo was not slaine at all, but reigned victoriouslie for the space of 48 y*entity*eres, and then departed this life, as in place afterwards it shall app*entity*ere.

Of this man ye haue heard partlie before <pb n="613"/>touching his dealings and warres against the Northumbers, and other of the English nation: but forsomuch as diuers other things are reported of him by the British writers, we haue thought good in this place to rehearse the same in part, as in Gal. Mon. we find writen, leauing the credit still with the author, sith the truth thereof may be the more suspected, bicause other authors of good authoritie, as Beda, Henrie Huntington, William Malmesburie, and others s*entity*eme greatlie to disagr*entity*e from him herein. But thus it is written.</p>
<p>This Cadwallo and Edwin the sonne of Ethelfred, as Galfride saith, were brought vp in 

<note place="marg">Edwin was not sonne to Ethelfred, but to Alla, or Elle, as in other places plainlie apeareth.</note>

 France, being sent thither vnto Salomon king of Britaine, by king Cadwane, when they were verie yoong. Now after their returne into this land, when they were made kings, Cadwallo of the Britains, *entity* Edwin of the Northumbers, there continued for the space of two y*entity*eres great friendship betwixt them, till at length Edwin required of Cadwallo that he might weare a crowne, and celebrate appointed solemnities within his dominion of Northumberland, as well as Cadwallo did in his countrie. Cadwallo taking aduice in this matter, at length by persuasion of his nephue Brian, denied to grant vnto Edwin his request, wherewith Edwin tooke such displeasure, that he sent woord vnto Cadwallo, that he would be crowned without his leaue or licence, sith he would not willinglie grant it. Wherto Cadwallo answered, that if he so did, he would cut off his head vnder his diademe, if he presumed to weare anie within the confines of Britaine. Hereof discord arising betwixt these two princes, they began to make fierce and cruell warre either of them against the other, and at length ioining in batell with their maine forces, Cadwallo lost the field, with many 

<note place="marg">Cadwallo vanquished by Edwin. Cadwallo flieth the land.</note>

 thousands of his men, and being chased fled into Scotland, and from thence got ouer into Ireland, and finally passed the seas into Britaine Armorike, where, of his coosin king Salomon he was courteouslie receiued, and at length obteined of him 10000 men to go with him backe into his countrie, to assist him in recouerie of his lands *entity* dominions, the which in the meane time were cruellie spoiled, wasted and haried by king Edwin.</p>
<p>At the same time Brian the nephue of Cadwallo, whom he had sent into Britaine as little before to slea a certeine wizard or southsaier, whom king Edwin had gotten out of Spaine named Pelitus, that by disclosing the purpose of Cadwallo vnto Edwin, greatlie hindered Cadwallos enterprises, had fortified the citie of Excester, mening to defend it till the comming of Cadwallo, wherevpon Penda king of Mercia besieged that citie with a mightie army, purposing to take it, and Brian within it. Cadwallo then aduertised hereof, immediatlie after his arriuall hasted to Excester, and duiding his people in 4 parts, set vpon his enimies, tooke Penda, and ouerthrew his whole armie. Penda hauing no other shift to escape, submitted himselfe wholie vnto Cadwallo, promising to become his liegeman, to fight against the Saxons in his quarrell. Penda being thus subdued, Cadwallo called his nobles togither which had bene dispersed abroad a long season, *entity* with all sp*entity*ed went against Edwin king of Northumberland, and slue him in battell at Hatfield (as before is mentioned) with his son Osfride, and Eodbold king of the Iles of Orknie, which was come thither to his aid.</p>
<p>*entity* By this it should appeare, that Fabian hath gathered amisse in the account of the reignes of the British kings: for it appeareth by Beda and others, that Edwin was slaine in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 634. And where Fabian (as before is said) attributeth that act *entity* 

<note place="marg"><date>634.</date></note>

 diuers other vnto Cadwan the father of this Cadwallo: yet both Gal. Mon. and Beda with the most part of all other writers signifie that it was done by Cadwallo. Harding assigneth but 13 y*entity*eres to the reigne of Cadwan, and declareth that he died in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 616, in the which (as he saith) Cadwallo began his reigne, which opinion of his s*entity*emeth best to agr*entity*e with that which is written by other authors. But to returne to the other dooings of Cadwallo, as we find them recorded in the British storie. After he had got this victorie against the Northumbers, he cruellie pursued the Saxons, as though he ment so farre as in him lay, to destroie the whole race of them out of the coasts of all Britaine: and sending Penda against king Oswald that succ*entity*eded Edwin, though at the first Penda receiued the ouerthrow at Heauenfield, yet afterwards Cadwallo himselfe highly displeased with that chance, pursued Oswald, and fought with him at a place called Bourne, where Penda <pb n="614"/>

<note place="marg">Oswald slaine.</note>

 slue the said Oswald. Wherevpon his brother Osunus succ*entity*eding in gouernment of the Northumbers, sought the fauour of Cadwallo now ruling as king ouer all Britaine, and at length by great gifts of gold and siluer, and vpon his humble submission, obteined peace, till at 

<note place="marg">Oswie. <emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 length vpon spite, Penda king of Mercia obteined licence of Cadwallo to make warres against 

<note place="marg"><date>654.</date></note>

 the said Osunus, in the which (as it hapned) Penda himselfe was slaine. Then Cadwallo after two y*entity*eres granted that Vifridus the sonne of Penda should succeed in Mercia.</p>
<p>Thus Cadwallo ruled things at his appointment within this land. And finallie when he 

<note place="marg"><date>678.</date></note>

 had reigned 48 y*entity*eres, he departed this life the 22 of Nouember. His bodie being embalmed

 and dressed with sw*entity*et confections, was put into a brasen image by maruelous art melted and cast, which image being set on a brazen horsse of excellent beautie, the Britains set vp aloft vpon the west gate of London called Ludgate, in signe of his conquests, and for a terror to the Saxons. Moreouer the church of S. Martin vnderneath the same gate, was by the Britains then builded. Thus haue the Britains made mention of their valiant prince Cadwallo, but diuerse thinke that much of this historie is but fables, bicause of the manifest varieng both from Beda and other autentike writers (as before I haue said.)</p>

<p>NOW will we (after all these differing discourses of the British chronologers) approch and draw as n*entity*ere as we can to the truth of the historie touching Oswald king of the Northumbers, 

<note place="marg">Oswald meaneth to be thankefull to God for his benefits. <emph>Beda li.</emph> 3. <emph>cap.</emph> 3. 5. 6. <emph>Heclor Boet.</emph></note>

 of whom we find, that after he had tasted of Gods high fauour extended to himwards, in vanquishing his enimies, as one minding to be thankefull therefore, he was desirous to restore the Christian faith through his whole kingdome, sore lamenting the decay thereof within the same, and therefore euen in the beginning of his reigne, he sent vnto Donwald the Scotish king (with whome he had b*entity*ene brought vp in the time of his banishment the space of 18 y*entity*eres) requiring him to haue some learned Scotishman sent vnto him, skilfull in preaching the word of life, that with godly sermons and wholesome instructions, he might conuert the people of Northumberland vnto the true and liuing God, promising to interteine him with such prouision as apperteined.</p>

<note place="marg">Corman.</note>

<p>At his instance, there was sent vnto him one Corman, a clerke singularlie well learned, and of great grauitie in behauiour: but for that he wanted such facilitie, and plaine vtterance by waie of gentle persuading, as is requisite in him that shall instruct the simple, onelie <pb n="615"/>setting foorth in his sermons high mysteries, and matters of such profound knowledge, as the verie learned might scarselie perceiue the perfect sense and meaning of his talke, his trauell came to small effect, so that after a y*entity*eres remaining there, he returned into his countrie, declaring amongst his brethren of the cleargie, that the people of Northumberland was a froward, stubborne and stiffe-harted generation, whose minds he could not frame by anie good meanes of persuasion to receiue the christian faith: so that he iudged it lost labour to spend more time amongst them, being so vnthankfull and intractable a people, as no good might be doone vnto them.</p>
<p>Amongst other learned and vertuous prelats of the Scots, there chanced one to be there present at the same time called Aidan, a man of so perfect life, that (as Beda writeth) he 

<note place="marg">Aidan.</note>

 taught no otherwise than he liued, hauing no regard to the cares of this world, but whatsoeuer was giuen him by kings or men of wealth and riches, that he fr*entity*elie bestowed vpon the poore, exhorting other to doo the like. This Aidan hearing Cormans woords, perceiued anon that the fault was not so much in the people as in the teacher, and therefore declared, that (as he thought) although it were so that the people of Northumberland gaue no such attentiue eare vnto the preaching of that reuerend prelate Corman, as his godlie expectation was they should haue doone, yet might it be that his vttering of ouer manie mysticall articles amongst them, farre aboue the capacitie of the vnderstanding of simple men, was the cause why they so lightlie regarded his diuine instructions, whereas if he had (according to the counsell of Saint Paule) at the first ministred vnto their tender vnderstandings, onelie milke, 

<note place="marg">S. Paules counsell.</note>

 without harder nourishments, he might happilie haue woone a farre greater number of them vnto the receiuing of the faith, and so haue framed them by little and little to haue digested stronger food. And therefore he thought it necessarie in discharge of their duties towards God, and to satisfie the earnest zeale of king Oswald, that some one amongst them might be appointed to go againe into Northumberland, to trie by proc*entity*eding in this maner afore alledged, what profit would thereof insue.</p>
<p>The bishops hearing the opinion of Aidan, and therewith knowing Cormans maner of preaching, iudged the matter to be as Aidan had declared, and therevpon not onelie allowed his woords, but also willed him to take the iournie vpon him, sith they knew none so able with effect to accomplish their wished desires in that behalfe. Aidan, for that he would not 

<note place="marg">Aidan commeth into England to preach to gospell.</note>

 seeme to refuse to take that in hand which he himselfe had motioned, was contented to satisfie their request, and so set forward towards Northumberland, and comming thither, was ioifullie receiued of king Oswald, who appointed him the Ile of Lindesfarne, wherein to place the see of his new bishoprike.</p>
<p>This Aidan in one point varied from the vse of the new begun church of England, that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda li.</emph> 3. <emph>ca.</emph> 3. <emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 is to say, touching the time of obseruing the feast of Easter, in like maner as all the bishops of the Scots and Picts inhabiting within Britaine in those daies did, following therein (as they tooke it) the doctrine of the holie and praise-woorthie father Anatholius. But the Scots that inhabited the south parts of Ireland, alreadie were agr*entity*ed to obserue that feast, according to the rules of the church of Rome. Howbeit Aidan being thus come into Northumberland, applied himselfe so earnestlie in praier and preaching, that the people had him within short while in woonderfull estimation, chiefelie for that he tempered his preachings with such sw*entity*et and pleasant matter, that all men had a great desire to heare him, insomuch that sometime he was glad to preach abroad in churchvards, hicause the audience was more than could haue roome in the church.</p>
<p>One thing was a great hinderance to him, that he had not the perfect knowledge of the Saxon toong. But Oswald himselfe was a great helpe to him in that matter, who being desirous of nothing so much, as to haue the faith of Christ rooted. in the harts of his subiects, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda.</emph> Oswald an interpretor to the preacher.</note>

 vsed as an interpretor to report vnto the people in their Saxon toong, such whole sermons as Aidan vttered in his mother toong. For Oswald hauing b*entity*ene brought vp (as ye haue hard) in Scotland during the time of his banishment, was as readie in the Scotish, as he was in the Saxon toong. The people then seeing the kings earnest desire in furthering <pb n="616"/>the doctrine set foorth by Aidan, were the more inclined to heare it: so that it was a maruelloas matter to note, what numbers of people dailie offred themselues to be baptised, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 insomuch that within the space of seuen daies (as is left in writing) he christened 15 thousand persons, of the which no small part forsaking the world, betooke themselues to a solitarie kind of life.</p>
<p>Thus by his earnest trauell in continuall preaching and setting foorth the gospell in that countrie, it came to passe in the end, that the faith was generallie receiued of all the people, and such zeale to aduance the glorie of the christian religion dailie increased amongst them, 

<note place="marg">Oswalds zeale to aduance religion.</note>

 that no where could be found greater. Heerevpon were no small number of churches built in all places abroad in those parties by procurement of the king, all men liberallie consenting (according to the rate of their substance) to be contributorie towards the charges. By this meanes the kingdome of the Northumbers flourished, as well in fame of increase in 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 5. <emph>ca.</emph> 6.</note>

 religion, as also in ciuill policie and prudent ordinances: insomuch that (as Beda writeth) 

<note place="marg">Oswald had in estimation with his neighbours.</note>

 Oswald atteined to such power, that all the nations and prouinces within Britaine, which were diuided into foure toongs (that is to say) Britains, Picts, Scots, and Englishmen, were at his commandement. But yet he was not lifted vp in anie pride or presumption, but shewed himselfe maruellous courteous amd gentle, and verie liberall to poore people and strangers.</p>
<p>It is said, that he being set at the table vpon an Ester day, *entity* hauing bishop Aidan at diner then with him, his almoner came in as the bishop was about to say grace, and declared to the king that there was a great multitude of poore folks set before the gates to looke for the kings almes. The king h*entity*erewith tooke a siluer dish, which was set on the table before him with meate, *entity* commanded the same meate streightwaies to be distributed amongst the poore, *entity* the dish broken into small p*entity*eces, and diuided amongst them: for which act he was highlie commended of the bishop, as he well deserued. By the good policie and diligent trauell of this king, the prouinces of Deira and Bernicia, which hitherto had b*entity*ene at variance, were brought to peace and made one.</p>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">ABOUT</hi> the same time, the Westsaxons were conuerted to the christian faith, by the preaching of one Birinus a bishop, who came into this land at the exhortation of pope Honorius, to set foorth the gospell vnto those people which as yet were not baptised. By whose diligent trauell in the Lords haruest, Kimgils or Kinigils, one of the kings of that countrie receiued the faith, and was baptised about the fiue *entity* twentith y*entity*ere of his reigne. K. Oswald that should haue had his daughter in mariage, was present the same time, who first yer he became a sonne in law, was made a godfather vnto Kinigils (that should be his father in law) by receiuing him at the fontstone, in that his second birth of regeneration. To this Birinus, who was an Italian, king Kinigils (now that he was become a conuert or christian) appointed 

<note place="marg">Dorcester ordeined a bishops s*entity*e.</note>

 and assigned the citie of Dorcester, situat by the Thames, distant from Oxford about seuen miles, to be the s*entity*e of his bishoprike, where he procured churches to be built, and by his earnest trauell *entity* setting foorth the woord of life, conuerted much people to the right beliefe. In the y*entity*ere following, Quichelmus the other king of the Westsaxons, and sonne to Kinigils was also christened, and died the same y*entity*ere, and so Cinigilsus or Kinigils reigned alone.</p>

<note place="marg">Henr. Hunt.</note>

<p>In this meane while Penda king of Mercia that succ*entity*eded next after Ciarlus, being a man 

<note place="marg">This chanced in the y*entity*ere 620, as <emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith.</note>

 giuen to s*entity*eke trouble in one place or other, leauied warre against the kings of Westsaxon, Kinigils and Quichelmus, the which, gathering their power, gaue him battell at Cirenchester, where both the parties fought it out to the vttermost, as though they had forsworne to giue place one to another, insomuch that they continued in fight and making of cruell slaughter till the night parted them in sunder. And in the morning, when they saw that if they shuld buckle togither againe, the one part should vtterlie destroie the other, they fell to agr*entity*ement in moderating ech others demands.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>640.</date></note>

<p>After this, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 640, Eadbald king of Kent departed this life, after

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 3. <emph>cap.</emph> 7. <emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 he had reigned 24 y*entity*eres, leauing his kingdome to his sonne Ercombert. This Ercombert was the first of the English kings, which tooke order for the vtter destroieng of all idols <pb n="617"/>throughout his whole kingdome. He also by his roiall authoritie commanded the fast of 

<note place="marg">Lent first ordeined to be kept in England. Segburga. Aimoinus.</note>

 fortie daies in the Lent season to be kept and obserued, appointing woorthie and competent punishment against the transgressors of that commandement. He had by his wife Segburga, that was daughter vnto Anna king of the Eastangles, a daughter named Eartongatha, a professed nunne within the monasterie of Briege or Cala in France: for in those daies, bicause there were not manie monasteries builded within this land, a great number of Englishmen, that tooke vpon them the profession of a religious life, got them ouer vnto abbeies in France, and there professed themselues moonks: and manie there were which sent their daughters ouer to be professed nuns within the nunneries there, and speciallie at Briege, Cala, and Andelie: amongst other, there were Sedrike the lawfull daughter, and Edelburgh the bastard daughter of the said king Anna, both which in processe of time were made abbesses of the said monasterie of Briege.</p>
<p>Ye haue heard alreadie, how Oswald king of Northumberland bare himselfe in all points like a most woorthie prince, not ceasing to releeue the necessitie of the poore, aduancing the good, and reforming the euill, whereby he wan to himselfe exc*entity*eding praise and commendation of all good men, and still his fame increased for his vertuous dooings; namelie, for the ardent zeale he had to the aduancing of the christian faith. Herevpon Penda king of Mercia, enuieng the prosperous proc*entity*edings of Oswald, as he that could neuer abide the good report of other mens well-dooings, began to imagine how to destroie him, and to conquere his kingdome, that he might ioine it to his owne.

 <pb n="618"/>of Yorke departed this life, and then one Thamar an Englishman of the parties of Kent was ordeined bishop of Rochester by Honorius the archbishop of Canturburie. King Oswie had one Oswin partener with him in gouernment of the Northumbers in the first beginning of 

<note place="marg">Bernicia.</note>

 his reigne, which was sonne to Osrike, so that Oswie gouerned in Bernicia, and Oswin in Deira, continuing in perfect friendship for a season, till at length, through the counsell of wicked persons, that coueted nothing so much as to sowe discord and variance betwixt princes, they fell at debate, and so began to make warres one against an other, so that finallie when they were at point to haue tried their quarrell in open battell, Oswin perceiuing that he had not an armie of sufficient force to incounter with Oswie, brake vp his campe at Wilfaresdowne, ten mile by west the towne of Cataracton, and after withdrew himselfe onelie with one seruant named Condhere vnto the house of earle Hunwald, whome he tooke to haue b*entity*ene his trustie friend: but contrarie to his expectation, the said Hunwald did betraie him vnto Oswie, who by his captaine Edelwine slue the said Oswin and his seruant the forsaid Condhere, in a place called Ingethling, the 13 kalends of September, in the ninth yeare

 of his reigne, which was after the birth of our Sauiour 651.</p>
<p>This Oswin was a goodlie gentleman of person, tall, and beautifull, and verie gentle of sp*entity*ech, ciuill in manners, and verie liberall both to high *entity* low, so that he was beloued of all. Such a one he was, to be breefe, as bishop Aidan gessed that he should not long continue in life, for that the Northumbers were not woorthie of so good and vertuous a gouernour. Such humblenesse and obedience he perceiued to rest in him towards the law of the Lord, in taking that which was told him for his better instruction in good part, that he said, he neuer saw before that time an humble king. The same Aidan liued not past 12 daies after the death of the said Oswin, whome he so much loued, departing this world the last daie of August, in the seuenteenth yeare after he was ordeined bishop. His bodie was buried in the Ile of Lindesferne. After Aidan, one Finan was made bishop in his place, a Scotishman also, and of the Ile of Hui, from whence his predecessor the foresaid Aidan came, being first a man of religion professed in the monasterie there (as some writers doo report.)</p>

 manner as his father had doone before him. In the third, or (as others saie) in the fift yeare of his reigne, Penda king of Mercia made sharpe warre against him, because he had put awaie his wife the sister of the said Penda, and in this warre Chenwald was ouercome in battell, *entity* driuen out of his countrie, so that he fled vnto Anna king of the Eastangles, with whome he remained the space of a yeare, or (as other say) thr*entity*e yeares, to his great good hap: for before he was growen to be an enimie to the christian religion, but now by the wholesome admonitions and sharpe rebukes of king Anna, he became a christian, and receiued his wife againe into his companie, according to the prescript of Gods law, and (to be br*entity*efe) in all things shewed himselfe a new man, imbracing vertue, *entity* auoiding vice, so that shortlie after (through the helpe of God) he recouered againe his kingdome.</p>

<note place="marg">Cedda.</note>

 assigning vnto him another priest to be his associat, sent them vnto the prouince of the Eastsaxons, there to preach the christian faith vnto the people. And when they had preached *entity* taught through the whole countrie, to the great increase and inlarging of the church of Christ, it chanced on a time that Cedda returned home into Northumberland to conferre of certeine things with bishop Finnan which kept his s*entity*e at Lindesferne, where vnderstanding by Cedda the great fruits which it had pleased God to prosper vnder his hands, in aduancing 

<note place="marg">Ced or Cedda bishop of the Eastsaxons.</note>

Whilest Ced was thus busie to the great comfort and ioy of the king and all his people, in the setting forward of the christian religion with great increase dailie proc*entity*eding, it chanced thorough the instigation of the deuill, the common enimie of mankind, that king Sigibert was murthered by two of his owne kinsmen who were brethren, the which when they were examined of the cause that should mooue them to that wicked fact, they had nothing to alledge, but that they did it bicause they had conceiued an hatred against the king, for that he was too fauourable towards his enimies, and would with great mildnesse of mind forgiue iniuries committed against him: such was the kings fault for the which he was murthered, bicause he obserued the commandements of the gospell with a deuout hart.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, in this his innocent death, his offense was punished, wherein he had suerlie transgressed the lawes of the church. For whereas one of them which slue him kept a wife, whome he had vnlawfullie maried, and refused to put hir away at the bishops admonition, he was by the bishop excommunicated, and all other of the christian congregation commanded to absteine from his companie. This notwithstanding, the king being desired of him came to his house to a banket, and in his comming from thence met with the bishop, whome when the king beheld, he waxed afraid, and alighted from his horsse, and fell downe at his f*entity*et, bes*entity*eching him of pardon for his offense. The bishop, which also was on horssebacke likewise alighted, and touching the king with his rod which he had in his hand, as one something displeased, and protesting as in the authoritie of a bishop, spake these words; "Bicause

<p>AFTER Sigbert succeeded Suidhelme in the kingdome of the Eastsaxons, he was the son of Sexbald, and baptised of Ced in the prouince of the Eastangles, at a place of the kings there called Rendlessham. Ediswald king of the Eastangles (the brother of king Anna) was his godfather at the fontstone. Ced the bishop of the Eastsaxons vsed oftentimes to 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib.</emph> 3. <emph>cap.</emph> 23.</note>

 visit his countrie of Northumberland where he was borne, and by preaching exhorted the people to godlie life. Whervpon it chanced that king Ediswald the son of king Oswald which reigned in the parties of Deira, mooued with the fame of his vertuous trade of liuing, had him in great reuerence: and therefore vpon a good zeale and great deuotion, willed him to choose foorth some plot of ground where he might build a monasterie, in the which the king himselfe and others might praie, heare sermons the oftener, and haue place where to burie the dead. The bishop consenting to the kings mind, at length espied a place amongst high and desert mounteins, where he began the foundation of a monasterie, afterwards called Lestinghem.</p>
<p>Wherefore meaning first of all to purge the place with praier *entity* fasting, he asked leaue of the king that he might remaine there all the Lent, which was at hand, and so continuing 

<note place="marg">The maner of the old fast.</note>

 in that place for that time, fasted euerie daie (sundaie excepted) from the morning vntill euening, according to the maner, nor receiued anie thing then but onlie a little bread, and a hens eg, with a little milke mixt with water: for he said that this was the custome of them of whome he had learned the forme of his regular order, that they should consecrate those places vnto the Lord with praier and fasting, which they latelie had receiued to make in the same either church or monasterie.</p>
<p>And when there remained ten daies of Lent yet to come, he was sent for to the king: wherefore he appointed a brother which he had, being also a priest named Cimbill, to supplie his roome, that his begun religious woorke should not be hindered for the kings businesse. Now when the time was accomplished, he ordeined a monasterie there, appointing the 

<note place="marg">Lindesferne holie Iland.</note>

 moonks of the same to liue after the rules of them of Lindesferne where he was brought vp. Finallie this bishop Ced comming vnto this monasterie afterwards by chance in time of a sicknesse, died there, and left that monasterie to the gouernance of another brother which he had named Ceadda, that was after a bishop, as afterwards shall be shewed. There were foure brethren of them, and all priests, Ced, Cimbill, Ceulin, and Ceadda, of the which Ced and Ceadda were bishops, as before is said.</p>

<p>About the same time, Oswie king of Northumberland was sore oppressed by the warres of Penda king of Mercia, so that he made great offers of high gifts, and great rewards vnto the said Penda for peace, but Penda refused the same, as he that meant vtterlie to haue destroied 

<note place="marg">War betw*entity*ene king Oswie *entity* king Penda.</note>

 the whole nation of Oswies people, so that Oswie turning himselfe to seeke helpe at the hands of the almightie, said: If the pagan refuse to receiue the gifts which we offer, let us make offer vnto him that knoweth how to accept them: and so binding himselfe by vow, promised that if he might obtein victorie, he would offer his daughter to be dedicate to the Lord <pb n="623"/>in perpetuall virginitie: and further would giue twelue manors, lordships or farmes to the building of monasteries: and so with a small armie he put himselfe in hazard of battell.</p>
<p>It is said that Penda had thirtie companies of men of warre, furnished with thirtie noble capteins or coronels, against whome came Oswie with his sonne Alchfrid, hauing but a small armie, but confirmed yet with hope in Christ Iesus. His other son Ecgfrid remained in hostage at that time with qu*entity*ene Cinnise. Edilwald the sonne of Oswald that gouerned Deira, *entity* ought to haue aided Oswie, was on the part of Penda against his countrie, and against his vncle, but in time of the fight he withdrew himselfe aside, to behold what chance would follow. The battell being begun, the thirtie pagan capteins were ouerthrowne and

This battell was fought n*entity*ere to the water of Inwet, the which being risen as then by reason of great raine, drowned more of the enimies than died of the Northumbers swoords.</p>
<p>After that Oswie had obteined this victorie, he performed promise in bestowing his daughter to the profession of virginitie, and also gaue the twelue manors, whereof six were in Deira, and six in Bernicia, conteining euerie of them ten housholds a p*entity*ece. Elfled also king

<p>The first bishop in the prouince of Mercia, and also of Lindesferne and the Middleangles

 was one Diunma. who died amongst the Middleangles. The second was Cellach, the which leauing his bishoprike returned into Scotland, for they were both of the nation of the Scots.

For qu*entity*ene Eufled that was his kinswoman got of hir husband king Oswie a place there for the foresaid Trumhere to build that abbeie vpon.</p>

But when Andrew was preuented by death, eftsoones Adrian should haue b*entity*ene made archbishop, but that he named one Theodore an other moonke that abode as then in Rome, but was borne in the citie of Tharsus in Cilicia, verie well learned both in the Gr*entity*eke and Latine, and being of reuerend yeares, as of 76. This Theodore by the presentment of Adrian, was appointed to be ordeined archbishop of Canturburie, with condition, that Adrian should neuerthelesse attend vpon him into England, both for that he had b*entity*ene twise before this time in France, and so knew the coasts; and againe, for that he might assist him in all things, and looke well to the matter, that Theodore should not bring into the church of England anie rite or custome of the Gr*entity*ekes, contrarie to the vse of the Romane church.

Howbeit, after it was perceiued that this suspicion was grounded on no truth, he was also suffered to follow the archbishop, and so comming vnto Canturburie, he was made abbat of the monasterie of saint Augustines. The archbishop Theodore came thus vnto. his church of Canturburie in the second yeare after his consecration, about the second kalends of June, being sundaie.

And thus when bishop Iaroman had accomplished the thing for the which he was sent, he returned into Mercia.</p>
<p>After this, when the said Iaroman was departed this life, king Vulfhere sent vnto the archbishop Theodorus, requiring him to prouide the prouince of the Mercies of a new bishop. Theodorus not minding to ordeine anie new bishop at that time, required Oswie king of Northumberland, that bishop Cead might come into Mercia to exercise the office of bishop there. This Cead liued as it were a priuat life at that time in his monasterie of Lestingham, for Wilfrid held the bishoprike of Yorke, extending his authoritie ouer all Northumberland *entity* amongest the Picts also, so farre as king Oswies dominion stretched. Therefore Cead <pb n="628"/>hauing licence to, go into Mercia, was gladlie receiued of king Vulfhere, and well enterteined, in so much that the said king gaue vnto him lands and possessions conteining 50 families or housholds to build a monasterie in a certeine place within the countrie of Lindsey called Etbearne. But the s*entity*e of his bishoprike was assigned to him at Lichfield in Staffordshire, where he made him a house n*entity*ere to the church, in the which he with 7 or 8 other of his brethren in religion vsed in an oratorie there to praie and reade, so often as they had leasure from labour and businesse of the world. Finallie, after he had gouerned the church of Mercia by the space of two yeares and an halfe, he departed this life, hauing 7 daies warning giuen him (as it is reported) from aboue, before he should die, after a miraculous maner, which because in the iudgement of the most it may s*entity*eme m*entity*ere fabulous, we will omit and passe ouer.

<note place="marg">Articles proponed by Theodore.</note>

 of these prelats, the archbishop shewed a booke, wherein he had noted ten chapters or articles taken out of the booke of the canons, requiring that the same might be receiued.</p>
<p>1 The first chapter was, that the feast of Easter should be kept on the sundaie following the fourt*entity*enth day of the first moneth.</p>
<p>2 The second, that no bishop should intermedle in an others diocesse, but be contented with the cure of his flocke committed to him.</p>
<p>3 The third, that no bishop should disquiet in anie thing anie monasterie consecrated to God, nor take by violence anie goods, that belonged vnto the same.</p>
<p>4 The fourth, that bishops being moonks should not go from monasterie to monasterie, except by sufferance and permission of their abbats, *entity* should continue in the same obedience wherein they stood before.</p>
<p>5 The fift, that none of the cleargie should depart from his bishop to run into anie other diocesse, nor comming from anie other place should be admitted, except he brought letters of testimonie with him. But if anie such chanced to be receiued, if he refused to returne, being sent for home, both he and his receiuer should be excommunicated.</p>
<p>6 The sixt, that bishops and other of the cleargie being strangers shold hold them content with the benefit of hospitalitie, *entity* should not take in hand anie priestlie office, without licence of the bishop, in whose diocesse he chanced so to be remaining.</p>
<p>7 The seuenth, that twice in the yeare a synod should be kept, but because of diuers impediments herein, it was thought good to them all, that in the kalends of August a synod should be kept once in the yeare, at a certeine place called Cloofeshough.</p>
<p>8 The eighth chapter was, that no one bishop should by ambition s*entity*eke to be preferred aboue another, but that euerie one should know the time and order of his consecration.</p>
<p>9 The ninth, that as the number of the christians increased, so should there be more bishops ordeined.</p>
<p>10 The tenth was touching mariages, that none should contract matrimonie with anie person, but with such as it should be lawfull for him by the orders of the church: none should match with their kinsfolke, no man should forsake his wife, except (as the gospell teacheth) for cause of fornication. But if anie man did put awale his wife which he had lawfullie married, <pb n="629"/>if he would be accounted a true christian, he might not be coopled with an other, but so remaine, or else be reconciled to his owne wife.</p>
<p>These articles, being intreated of and concluded, were confirmed with the subscribing of all their hands, so as all those that did go against the same, should be disgraded of their priesthood, and separated from the companie of them all.</p>

<note place="marg">The church of Rippon.</note>


<p>After that bishop Wilfrid was expelled out of his diocesse and prouince of the Northumbers, he went to Rome, and returning from thence, came into the kingdome of the Southsaxons, the which conteining seuen thousand housholds or families, as yet was not conuerted to the christian faith. Wherefore the said Wilfrid began there to preach the gospell with

 licence of king Edilwalke, who (as before is mentioned) was conuerted and baptised in Mercia by the procurement of king Wolfher, that then became his godfather, and gaue him at the same time the Ile of Wight, and the prouince of the people ancientlie called Meanuari, which he had woon from the Westsaxons. Bishop Wilfrid then by king Edilwalke his furtherance and helpe baptised the chiefest lords and gentlemen of that prouince.

But as God would, the same day that Wilfrid began to minister the sacrament of baptisme, there came downe sw*entity*et and plentifull showers of raine, so watering the earth, that thereby great store of all fruits plentifullie tooke root, and y*entity*elded full increase in growth, to the great comfort and reliefe of all the people, which before were in maner starued and lost through want of food.</p>
<p>Bishop Wilfrid also taught them in that countrie the maner how to catch fish with nets, 

<note place="marg">Catching of fish with nets.</note>

 where before that time, they had no great skill in anie kind of fishing, except it were in catching *entity*eles. Hereby the said bishop grew there in great estimation with the people, so that his words were the better credited amongst them, for that through him they receiued so great benefits, God by such meanes working in the peoples hearts a desire to come to the vnderstanding of his lawes. The king also gaue vnto Wilfrid a place called Sealesew, compassed about on each side (except on the west halfe) with the sea, conteining 87 housholds or families, where he built an abbeie, and baptised all his tenants there, amounting to the number of 250 bondmen and bondwomen, whome he made fr*entity*e both in bodie and soule:

The archbishop of Canturburie Theodorus perceiuing that great warre and effusion of bloud was like to follow therevpon, trauelled so in the matter betwixt them, that they were made friends, and Egfrid had a p*entity*ece of monie in recompense of his losses.

<p>BUT now to returne vnto that which is found in the British histories, by the tenor 

<note place="marg">CADWAL LADER.</note>

 wherof it should appeare, that when their king Cadwallo was dead, his son Cadwallader succ*entity*eded him in gouernement of the Britains, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 678, which was 

<note place="marg">676 saith <emph>Maith. West.</emph></note>

 about the 10 y*entity*ere of the emperour Constantius Paganotus, and in the 13 y*entity*ere of the reigne of Childericus king of France. This Cadwallader, being the sonne of Cadwallo, was begot 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gaifrid.</emph></note>

 by him of the halfe sister of Penda king of Mercia, for one father begot them both, but of two sundrie mothers, for she had to mother a ladie descended of the noble blood of the Westsaxons, and was maried vnto Cadwallo when the peace was made betwixt him and hir brother the said Penda. After that Cadwallader had reigned the space of 12 y*entity*ers (as Geffrey of Monmouth saith) or (as others write) but 3 y*entity*eres, the Britains were brought into such miserie through ciuill discord, and also by such great and extreme famine as then reigned through all the land, that Cadwallader was constreined with the ch*entity*efest part of his people to 

<note place="marg">Cadwallader constreined to forsake the land.</note>

 forsake their natiue countrie, and by sea to get them ouer into Britaine Armorike, there to s*entity*eke reliefe by vittels for the sustentation of their languishing bodies.</p>
<p>*entity* Long processe is made by the British writers of this departure of Cadwallader, *entity* of the Britains out of this land, and how Cadwallader was about to haue returned againe, but that he was admonished by a dreame to the contrarie, the which bicause it s*entity*emeth but fabulous, we passe ouer. At length he went to Rome, and there was confirmed in the christian religion by pope Sergius, where shortlie after he fell sicke, and died the 12 kalends of May, in the yeere of our Lord 689. But herein appeareth the error of the British writers in taking 

<note place="marg"><date>689.</date></note>

 one for another, by reason of resemblance of names, for where Ceadwalla king of the Westsaxons about that time mooued of a religious deuotion, after he was conuerted to the faith, went vnto Rome, and was there baptised, or else confirmed of the foresaid pope Sergius, and shortlie after departed this life in that citie in the foresaid y*entity*ere of 689 or therabouts. The Welshmen count him to be their Cadwallader: which to be true is verie vnlike by that which may be gathered out of the learned writings of diuers good and approoued authors.</p>
<p><hi rend="smallcap">THIS</hi> Ceadwalla king of the Westsaxons succeeded after Centwine or Centiuinus, which 

<note place="marg">CEADWALLA. <emph> Will. Malm. Beda.</emph></note>

 Centwine reigned nine yeeres, though it should appeare by that which is written by authors of good credit, that during two of those y*entity*eres at the least, the kingdome of Westsaxons was diuided betwixt him and Elcuinus or Escuinus, so that he should not reigne past seuen yeeres alone.</p>
<p>But now to Ceadwalla, whome some take to be all one with Cadwallader, we find that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Ranulf. Cest.</emph></note>

 he was lineallie descended from Cutha or Cutwine, the brother of Ceauline or Keuling king of Westsaxons, as sonne to Kenbert or Kenbright that was sonne to Ceadda the sonne <pb n="634"/>of the foresaid Cutha or Cutwin. Thus being extract of the noble house of the kings of Westsaxons, he prooued in his youth a personage of great towardnesse, and such a one as no small hope was of him conceiued: he would let no occasion passe wherein he might exercise his force, to shew proofe of his high valiancie, so that in the end with his woorthie attempts shewed therein, he purchased to himselfe the enuie of those that ruled in his countrie, by 

<note place="marg">Ceadwalla driuen to depart out of his countrie.</note>

 reason whereof he was banished in a conspiracie made against him. Wherevpon he tooke occasion as it were in reuenge of such vnthankfulnesse to withdraw out of his countrie, leading with him all the principall youth of the same, the which either pitieng his present estate, or mooued with pleasure taken in his valiant dooings, followed him at his going into exile.</p>
<p>The first brunt of his furious attempts after he was out of his countrie, Edilwalke the king of the Southsaxons tasted, who in defense of himselfe comming to trie battell with Ceadwalla, was slaine with the most part of all his armie. Ceadwalla then perceiuing the valiant courages of his souldiers, filled with good hope of this happie atchiued victorie, returned with good and prosperous sp*entity*ed into his owne countrie, and that yer he was looked for, and earnestlie pursuing his aduersaries, droue them out of the kingdome, and taking vpon him to rule the same as king, reigned two y*entity*eres, during the which he atchiued diuers notable enterprises.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda lib</emph> 4. <emph>cap.</emph> 15.</note>

<p>And first, whereas Berthun and Authun dukes of Sussex *entity* subiects vnto the late king Edilwalke, had both expelled him out of that countrie, after he had slaine the said Edilwalke, and also taken vpon them the rule of that kingdome, hauing now atteined to the gouernement 

<note place="marg">Berthun a duke of Sussex slaine.</note>

 of the Westsaxons, he inuaded the countrie of Sussex againe, and slue Berthun in battell, bringing that countrie into more bondage than before. He also set vpon the Ile of Wight, and well-n*entity*ere destroied all the inhabitants, meaning to inhabit it with his owne people. Hee 

<note place="marg">Ceadwalla his vow. The Ile of Wight conquered.</note>

 bound himselfe also by vow, although as yet he was not baptised, that if he might conquer it, he would giue a fourth part thereof vnto the Lord. And in performance of that vow, he offered vnto bishop Wilfride (who then chanced to be present) when he had taken that Ile, so much therof as conteined 300 housholds or families, where the whole consisted in 1200 housholds. Wilfrid receiuing thankefullie the gift, deliuered the same vnto one of his clearks named Bernewine that was his sisters sonne, appointing to him also a priest named Hildila, the which should minister the word and the sacrament of baptisme vnto all those that would receiue the 

<note place="marg">The Ile of Wight receiueth the faith.</note>

 same. Thus was the Ile of Wight brought to the faith of Christ last of all other the parties of this our Britaine, after that the same faith had failed here by the comming of the Saxons.</p>
<p>Moreouer, king Ceadwalla inuaded the kingdome of Kent, where he lost his brother Mollo, as after shall app*entity*ere, but yet he reuenged his death with great slaughter made of the inhabitants in that countrie. Finallie, this worthie prince Ceadwalla, turning himselfe from the desire of warre and bloudshed, became right courteous, gentle and liberall towards all men, so that ye could not haue wished more vertuous manners to rest in one as yet not christened. And shortlie after, Willing to be admitted into the fellowship of the Christians (of whose religion he had taken good tast) he went to Rome, where of pope Sergius he was baptised, and named Peter, and shortlie after surprised with sickenesse, he died, and was buried there within

<p>In the meane while, that is to say, in the yeere of our Lord 684, Egfride king of Northumberland thumberland sent an armie vnder the guiding of a capteine named Bertus into Ireland, the which wasted that countrie, sparing neither church nor monasterie, sore indamaging the people of that countrie, which had euer beene friends vnto the English nation, and deserued nothing lesse than so to be inuaded and spoiled at their hands. The Irish men defended themselues to their power, bes*entity*eching God with manie a salt teare, that he would reuenge their cause in punishing of such extreme iniuries. And though cursers may not inherit the kingdome of heauen, yet they ceased not to curse, hoping the sooner that those which with good cause were thus accursed, should woorthilie be punished for their offenses by God, *entity* so 

<note place="marg">King Egfride slain by Brudeus king of the Picts.</note>

 (peraduenture) it fell out. For in the yeere following, the said Egfride had lead an armie into Pictland against Brudeus king of the Picts and being trained into straits within hils and <pb n="635"/>craggie mounteins, he was slaine with the most part of all his armie, in the yeere of his age 40, and of his reigne 15, vpon the 13 kalends of June.</p>
<p>There were diuers of Egfrides friends, and namelie Cutberd (whome he had aduanced the same y*entity*ere vnto the bishops se*entity* of Lindesferne) that aduised him in no wise, either to haue taken this warre in hand against the Picts, or the other against them of Ireland, but he would not be counselled, the punishment appointed for his sinnes being such, that he might not giue eare to his faithfull friends that aduised him for the best. From that time foorth, the hope and power of the English people began to decaie. For not onelie the Picts recouered 

<note place="marg">These Britains were those vndouttedlie yt dwelt in the northwest parts of this Ile, and is not ment onlie by them of Wales.</note>

 that part of their countrie which the Englishmen had held before in their possession, but also the Scots that inhabited within this Ile, and likewise some part of the Britains tooke vpon them libertie, which they kept and mainteined a long time after, as Beda confesseth.</p>
<p>Egfride died without issue, *entity* left no children behind him. He had to wife one Ethelreda or Etheldrida, daughter vnto Anna king of the Eastangles, which liued with hir husband the forsaid Egfride twelue y*entity*eres in perfect virginitie (as is supposed) contrarie to the purpose of hir husband, if he might haue persuaded hir to the contrarie, but finallie he was contented that she should k*entity*epe hir first vow of chastitie which she had made. She was both widow 

<note place="marg">Ethelreda.</note>

 and virgine when he maried hir, being first coupled in wedlocke with one Eunbert a noble man, and a ruler in the south parts of the countrie, where the people called Giruij inhabited, 

<note place="marg">Giruij.</note>

 which is the same where the fennes lie in the confines of Lincolnshire, Norffolke, Huntingtonshire, *entity* Cambridgeshire howbeit he liued with hir but a small while. After she had obteined licence to depart from the court, she got hir first into Coldingham abbeie, and there was professed a nun. Then she went to Elie, and there restored the monasterie, and was made abbesse of the place, in the which after she had gouerned seuen yeeres, she departed this life, and was there buried. This same was she which commonlie is called saint Audrie of Elie, had in great reuerence for the opinion conceiued of hir great vertue and puritie of life.</p>

About the 13 yeare of his reigne, that is to say, in the yeare of our Lord 698, one of his capteins named earle Berthred, or Bertus, was slaine in battell by the

<p>The same yeare, or in the yeare after that king Egfrid was slaine, Lother king of Kent departed this life, the 8 Ides of Februarie, of a wound by him receiued in a battell which he fought against the Southsaxons, the which came in aid of Edrike, that was sonne vnto his brother Egbert, and had mainteined warre against his vncle the said Lother, euen from the beginning of his reigne, till finallie he was now in the said battell striken thorough the bodie with a dart, and so died thereof, after he had reigned 11 yeares, and seuen moneths. It was thought that he was disquieted with continuall warres and troubles, and finallie brought to his end before the naturall course of his time, for a punishment of his wicked consent giuen to

But we will let this passe without further discourse, meaning hereafter in due place to declare the processe.</p>
<p>The Kentishmen being destitute of a king, after that diuers had coueted the place, and sought to atteine thereto, as well by force as otherwise, to the great disquieting of that prouince for the space of 6 yeares togither, at length in the 7 yeare after Edricks death, Withred an other of the sonnes of king Egbert, hauing with diligent trauell ouercome enuie at home, *entity* with monie rede*entity*med peace abaoad, was with great hope conceiued of his worthinesse made

 king of Kent, the 11 of Nouember, *entity* 205 after the death of Hengist, he reigned 33 yeares, not deceiuing his subiects of their good conceiued opinion of him: for ouercomming all his aduersaries which were readie to leuie ciuill warre against him, he also purchased peace of Inas king of the Westsaxons, which ment to haue made him warre, till with monie he was made his friend.</p>
<p>A little before that Withred was confirmed in the kingdome of Kent, there reigned two 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt. Beda. lib.</emph> 5. Suebhard and Nidred kings by vsurpation and not by succession, as <emph>Henr. Hant.</emph> writeth.</note>

 kings in that countrie, Suebhard and Nidred, or rather the same Withred, if the printed copie of Bedas booke intituled "Ecclesiastica historia gentis Anglorum" haue not that name corrupted: for where he sheweth that the archbishop Theodorus being of the age of 88 yeares, departed this life in the yeare of our Lord 690, in the next chapter he declareth, that in the yeare 692, the first date of Iulie one Brightwald was chosen to succ*entity*ed in the archbishops s*entity*e of Canturburie, Withredus and Suebhardus as then reigning in Kent: but whether Withredus gouerned as then with Suebhardus, or that some other named Nidred, it forceth not: for certeine it is by the agr*entity*ement of other writers, that till Withred obteined the whole rule, there was great strife and contention moued about the gouernement, and diuers there were that sought and fought for it. But this ought to be noted, that the forenamed Brightwald 

<note place="marg">Brightwald the first archbishop of the English nation.</note>

 was the eight archbishop in number, and first of the English nation that sat in the s*entity*e of Canturburie: for the other seuen that were predecessors to him, were strangers borne, and sent hither from Rome.</p>
<p>*entity* Here endeth the line and gouernement of the Britains, now called Welshmen, which tooke that name of their duke or leader Wallo or Gailo; or else of a queene of Wales named Gales or Wales. But howsoeuer that name fell first vnto them, now they are called Welshmen, which sometime were called Britains or Brutons, and descended first of the Troians, and after of Brute, and lastlie of Muimucius Dunwallo: albeit they were mingled with sundrie other nations, as Romans, Picts, *entity*c. And now they be called English that in their beginning were named Saxons or Angles. To conclude therefore with this gouernement, so manie times intercepted by forren power, it appeareth by course of histories treating of these matters, that the last yeare of Cadwallader was the yeare of our Lord 686, which makes the yere of the world 4647. So that (as Fabian saith) the Britains had the greater part of this land in rule (reckoning from Brute till this time) 1822 yeares. Which terme being expired, the whole dominion of this realme was Saxonish.</p>

<note place="marg">The Britains ceasse to reigns in this land</note>

 y*entity*ere of the reigne of Eugenius king of Scots. Now because the rule of the Britains commonlie called Welshmen, ceassed in this realme, as by confession of their owne writers it app*entity*ereth, and that in the end the whole monarchie of the same realme came to the hands of the kings of Westsaxons, we haue thought m*entity*et to refer things generall vnto the reignes of the same kings, as before we did in the Britaine kings, reseruing the particular dooings to the kings of the other prouinces or kingdoms, as the same haue fallen out, and shall come to hand.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian. H. Hunt.</emph></note>

<p>This Inas, whome some (mistaking N for V) doo wrongfullie name Iue or Iewe, prooued a right excellent prince, he was descended of the ancient linage of the kings of the Westsaxons, as sonne to one Kenred, that was sonne to Ceolwald the son of Cutha or Cutwine, that was sonne to Kenricke the sonne of Certicus, the first king of Westsaxons. But he was admitted to the kingdome more for the valiant prowes knowne to rest in his woorthie person, than for the successiue ofspring of which he was descended. The first voiage that he made, was against the Kentishmen, on whome he purposed to reuenge the death of his coosen 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. Westm. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 Mollo, the griefe whereof as yet he kept in fresh memorie. But when the Kentishmen perceiued, that to resist him by force, they were nothing able, they attempted by monie to buy their peace, and so obteined their purpose, vpon paiment made to him of thirtie thousand marks of siluer.</p>

<pb n="639"/>
<p>After this, about the 21 y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Inas and his coosen Nun fought with 

<note place="marg">Anno 708, as is noted by <emph>Matt. West. H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Gerent king of the Britains. In the beginning of the battell, one Higelbald a noble man of the Westsaxons part was slaine, but in the end Gerent with his Britains was chased. In the 26 y*entity*ere of his reigne, the same Inas fought a mightie battell against Cheolred king of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West.</emph> saith 718.</note>

 Mercia, at Wodenessburie, with doubtfull victorie, for it could not well be iudged whether part susteined greater losse. In the 36 y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Inas inuaded the Southsaxons with a mightie armie, and slue in battell Ealdbright or Aldinius king of the Southsaxons, and ioined that kingdome vnto the kingdome of the Westsaxons: so that from 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West</emph> saith 722. The end of the kingdome of the Southsaxons.</note>

 thencefoorth the kingdome of those Southsaxons ceassed, after they had reigned in that kingdome by the space of fiue kings successiuelie, that is to say, Ella, Cissa, Ethelwalke, Berutius, and this last Aldinius or Ealdbright.</p>
<p>Finallie, when Inas had reigned 37 y*entity*eres, and 10 or 11 od moneths, he renounced the rule of his kingdome, togither with all worldlie pompe, and went vnto Rome as a poore pilgrime, 

<note place="marg">Inas went to Rome and there died.</note>

 and there ended his life: but before this, during the time of his reigne, he shewed himselfe verie deuout and zealous towards the aduancement of the christian religion. He made and ordeined also good *entity* wholesome lawes for the amendment of maners in the people, which are yet extant and to be read, written in the Saxon toong, and translated into the Latine in times past, and now latelie againe by William Lambert gentleman, and printed by Iohn Day, in the y*entity*ere 1568, togither with the lawes and statutes of other kings before the conquest, as to the learned maie app*entity*ere.</p>
<p>Moreouer, king Ine builded the monasterie of Glastenburie, where Ioseph of Arimathea

 This Aldhelme was a learned man, and was first made abbat of Malmesburie, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 675, by Eleutherius then bishop of the Westsaxons, by whose diligence that abbeie was greatlie aduanced, being afore that time founded by one Medulfe a Scotish man, but of so small reuenues afore Aldhelms time, that the moonks were scarse able to liue thereon.

 and the other after the setting thereof: so that the one came before the breake of the day, and the other before the closing of the night, stretching foorth their fierie brands toward the north; and they appeered thus euerie morning and euening for the space of a fortnight togither, menacing as it were some great destruction or common mishap to follow.

<p>Now when Wichtred king of Kent had gouerned the Kentishmen by the space of 33 y*entity*eres, with great commendation for the good orders which he caused to be obserued amongst them, as well concerning matters ecclesiasticall as temporall, he departed this life, leauing behind him thr*entity*e sonnes, who successiuelie reigned as heires to him one after another (that is to say) Edbert 23 y*entity*eres, Ethelbert 11 yeeres currant, and Alrike 34 yeeres, the which three princes following the steps of their father in the obseruance of politike orders *entity* commendable lawes, vsed for the more part their fathers good lucke and fortune, except that

<p>In the y*entity*ere of our Lord 731, Betrwald archbishop of Canturburie departed this life in the fift ides of Ianuarie, after he had gouerned that see by the space of 27 y*entity*eres, 6 moneths, and 14 daies: in whose place the same y*entity*ere one Tacwine was ordeined archbishop, that before was a priest in the monasterie of Bruidon within the prouince of Mercia.

<note place="marg">Bishops what prouinces they gonerned.</note>

<p>*entity* As touching the state of the English church for ecclesiasticall gouernours, certeine it is, that the same was as hereafter followeth. The prouince of Canturburie was gouerned touching the ecclesiasticall state by archbishop Tacwine, and bishop Aldwulfe. The province <pb n="643"/>of the Eastsaxons by bishop Ingwald. The prouince of Eastangles by bishop Eadbertus and Hadulacus, the one k*entity*eping his s*entity*e at Elsham, and the other at Dunwich. The prouince of the Westsaxons was gouerned by the foresaid Daniell and by Forthere, who succ*entity*eded next after Aldhelme in the see of Shereburne. This Forthere in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 738, left his bishoprike, and went to Rome in companie of the qu*entity*ene of the Westsaxons. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 Many as well kings as bishops, noble and vnnoble, priests and laiemen, togither with women, vsed to make such iournies thither in those daies. The prouince of Mercia was ruled by the foresaid Aldwine bishop of Lichfield, and one bishop Walstod holding his s*entity*e at Herford gouerned those people that inhabited beyond the riuer of Sauerne toward the west. The prouince of Wiccies, that is, Worcester, one Wilfride gouerned. The Southsaxons and the Ile of Wright were vnder the bishop of Winchester. In the prouince of the Northumbers were foure bishops, that is to say, Wilfride archbishop of Yorke, Edilwald bishop of Lindisferne, Acca bishop of Hexham, and Pecthelmus bishop of Whiterne, otherwise called Candida Casa, he was the first that gouerned that church after the same was made a bishops s*entity*e. And thus stood the state of the English church for ecclesiasticall gouernors in that season.</p>
<p>And as for temporall gouernement, king Ceolvulfe had the souereigne dominion ouer all 

<note place="marg">Ethelbald K. of Mercia, of what puisauce he was.</note>

 the Northumbers: but all the prouinces on the southside of Humber, with their kings and rulers, were subiect vnto Edilbald or Ethelbald king of Mercia. The nation of the Picts were in league with the English men, and gladlie became partakers of the catholike faith and veritie of the vniuersall church. Those Scots which inhabited Britaine, contenting themselues with their owne bounds, went not about to practise anie deceitfull traines nor fraudulent deuises against the Englishmen. The Britains otherwise called Welshmen, though for the more part of a peculiar hatred they did impugne the English nation, *entity* the obseruance of the feast of Ester appointed by.the whole catholike church, yet (both diuine and humane force vtterlie resisting them) they were not able in neither behalfe to atteine to their wished intentions, as they which though they were partlie fr*entity*e, yet in some point remained still as thrall and mancipate to the subiection of the Englishmen: who (saith Beda) now in the acceptable time of peace and quietnesse, manie amongst them of Northumberland, laieng armour and weapon aside, applied themselues to the reading of holie scriptures, more desirous to be professed in religious houses, than to exercise feates of warre: but what will come therof (saith. he) the age that followeth shall s*entity*e and behold. With these words dooth Beda end his historie, continued till the y*entity*ere of our Lord 731, which was from the comming of the Englishmen into this land, about 285 y*entity*eres, according to his account.</p>
<p>In the y*entity*ere following, that is to say 732, in place of Wilfrid the second, Egbert was ordeined 

<note place="marg"><date>732.</date></note>

 deined bishop of Yorke. This Egbert was brother vnto an other Egbert, who as then was king of Northumberland, by whose helpe he greatlie aduanced the see of Yorke, and recouered 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 the pall: so that where all the other bishops that held the same s*entity*e before him sith Paulins daies, wanted the pall, and so were counted simplie but particular bishops: now was he intituled by the name of archbishop. He also got togither a great number of good books, which he bestowed in a librarie at Yorke. *entity* In the y*entity*ere 733, on the 18 kalends

 82 y*entity*eres of age, vpon Ascension day, which was the 7 kalends of Iune, and 26 of Maie, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Beda departed</emph> this life.</note>

 as Matt. Westm. hath diligentlie obserued. W. Harison. addeth hitherto, that it is to be read in an old epistle of Cutbert moonke of the same house vnto Cuthwine, that the said Beda lieng in his death-bed, translated the gospell of saint Iohn into English, and commanded his brethren to be diligent in reading and contemplation of good bookes, and not to exercise themselues with fables and friuolous matters. Finallie he was buried in the abbeie of Geruie, distant fiue miles from Wiremouth, an abbeie also in the north parts, not far from Newcastell (as is before remembred.) He was brought vp in those two abbeies, <pb n="644"/>and was scholer to Iohn of Beuerley. How throughlie he was s*entity*ene in all kinds of good literature, the bookes which h*entity*e wrote doo manifestlie beare witnesse. His iudgement also was so much est*entity*emed ouer all, that Sergius the bishop of Rome wrote vnto Celfride the abbat of Wiremouth, requiring him to send Beda vnto the court of Rome for the deciding of certein questions mooued there, which without his opinion might s*entity*eme to rest doubtfully But whether he went thither or not we can not affirme: but as it is thought by men worthie of credit, he neuer went out of this land, but continued for the most part of his life in the abbeies of Geruie and Wiremouth, first vnder Benet the first abbat and founder of the same abbeies, and after vnder the said Celfride, in whose time he receiued orders of priesthood at the hands of bishop Iohn, surnamed of Beuerley: so that it may be maruelled that a man borne in the vttermost corner of the world, should proue so excellent in all knowledge and learning, that his fame should so spread ouer the whole earth, and went neuer out of his

<p>The same y*entity*ere died archbishop Tacuine, and in the y*entity*ere following, that is to say 735, Nothelmus was ordeined archbishop of Canturburie in his place, and Egbert the archbishop of Yorke the same y*entity*ere got his pall from Rome, and so was confirmed archbishop, and ordeined two bishops, Fruidberd, and Fruidwald.

Then Sigibert, as he was fearefull of nature; fearing to be apprehended, got him into the wood called as then Andredeswald, and there hid himselfe, but by chance a swineheard that belonged to the late earle Cumbra at Priuetsfloud found him out, and perceiuing what he was, slue him in reuenge of his maisters death.</p>

<p>Finallie king Offa (as it were for a meane to appease Gods wrath, which he doubted to be iustlie conceiued towards him for his sinnes and wickednesse) granted the tenth part of all his goods vnto churchmen, and to poore people. He also indowed the church of Hereford

<p>Amongst other the dooings of this Offa, which suerlie were great and maruellous, this may not passe with silence, that he caused a mightie great ditch to be cast betwixt the marshes of his countrie, and the Welsh confines, to diuide thereby the bounds of their dominions.

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt. Iohn Capgraue. Matth. West.</emph> and others. Ethelbert king of Eastangles.</note>

<p>After that Ethelbert king of Eastangles was dead, his sonne Ethelbert succ*entity*eded him, a prince of great towardnesse, and so vertuouslie brought vp by his fathers circumspect care and diligence, that he vtterlie abhorred vice, and delighted onelie in vertue and commendable exercises, for the better atteining to knowledge and vnderstanding of good sciences. There remaine manie sundrie saiengs *entity* dooings of him, manifestlie bearing witnesse that there 

<note place="marg">The saieng of king Ethelbert.</note>

 could not be a man more honorable, thankefull, courteous or gentle. Amongest other he had this saieng oftentimes in his mouth, that the greater that men were, the more humble they ought to beare themselues: for the Lord putteth proud and mightie men from their seates, and exalteth the humble and m*entity*eke.</p>
<p>Moreouer he did not onelie shew himselfe wise in words, but desired also to excell in staiednesse of maners, and continencie of life. Whereby he wan to him the hearts of his people, who perceiuing that he was nothing delighted in the companie of women, and therefore minded not mariage, they of a singular loue and fauour towards him, required that he should in anie wise yet take a wife, that he might haue issue to succ*entity*ed him. At length the matter being referred to his councell, he was persuaded to follow their aduises. And so Alfreda the daughter of Offa king of Mercia was affianced to him: so that he himselfe appointed (as meanes to procure more fauour at his father in lawes hands) to go fetch the bride from hir fathers house.</p>
<p>Manie strange things that happened to him in taking vpon him this iournie, put him in

 great doubt of that which should follow. He was no sooner mounted on his horsse, but that (as s*entity*emed to him) the earth shooke vnder him: againe, a she was in his iournie, about the mid-time of the day, such a darke mist compassed him on ech side, that he could not s*entity*e nor discerne for a certeine time anie thing about him at all: lastlie, as he laie one night asl*entity*epe, he thought he saw in a dreame the roofe of his owne palace fall downe to the ground.

 honourablie receiued him: but his wife named Quendred, a wise woman, but therewith wicked, conceiued a malicious deuise in hir hart, *entity* streightwaies went about to persuade hir husband to put it in execution, which was to murther king Ethelbert, and after to take into his hands his kingdome.</p>
<p>Offa at the first was offended with his wife for this motion, but in the end, through the importunate request of the woman, he consented to hir mind. The order of the murther 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Capgt.</emph> Winnebert.</note>

 was committed vnto one Winnebert, that had serued both the said Ethelbert *entity* his father

 before time, the which feining as though he had beene sent from Offa to will Ethelbert to come vnto him in the night season, slue him that once mistrusted not anie such treason. Offa hauing thus dispatched Ethelbert, inuaded his kingdome, and conquered it.</p>
<p>But when the bride Alfreda vnderstood the death of hir liked make and bridegrome, abhorring the fact, she curssed father and mother, and as it were inspired with the spirit of prophesie, pronounced that woorthie punishment would shortlie fall on hir wicked mother for hir heinous crime committed in persuading so detestable a d*entity*ed: and according to hir woords it came to passe, for hir mother died miserablie within three moneths after. The maid 

<note place="marg">Alfreda a nun. <emph>Beda. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 Alfreda refusing the world, professed hirselfe a nun at Crowland, the which place began to wax famous about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 695, by the meanes of one Gutlake, a man esteemed of great vertue and holinesse, which chose to himselfe an habitation there, and departing this life about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 714, was buried in that place, where afterwards an abbeie of moonks was builded of saint Benets order. The bodie of K. Ethelbert at length was buried at Hereford, though first it was committed to buriall in a vile place, n*entity*ere to the banke of a riuer called Lug.</p>
<p>The kingdome of Eastangles from thencefoorth was brought so into decaie, that it remained subject one while vnto them of Mercia, an other while vnto the Westsaxons, and somewhile vnto them of Kent, till that Edmund surnamed the martyr got the gouernment thereof (as after shall app*entity*ere.) After that Selred king of the Eastsaxons had gouerned the tearme of 38 y*entity*eres, he was slaine, but in what maner, writers haue not expressed. After 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 him succ*entity*eded one Swithed or Swithred, the 11 and last in number that particularlie gouerned those people. He was finallie expelled by Egbert K. of Westsaxons, the same y*entity*ere that the said Egbert ouercame the Kentishmen (as after shall be shewed) and so the kings of that kingdome of the Eastsaxons ceassed and tooke end.</p>
<p>*entity* About this time, there was a maid in Oxford named Friswide, daughter to a certeine 

<note place="marg">Frswide a virgine.</note>

 duke or noble man called Didanus, with whome one Algar a prince in those parties fell in loue, and would haue rauished hir, but God the reuenger of sinnes was at hand (as the storie saith.) For when Algar followed the maid that fled before him, she getting into the towne, the gate was shut against him, and his sight also was suddenlie taken from him. But the maid by hir praiers pacified Gods wrath towards him, so that his sight was againe restored to him. But whether this be a fable or a true tale, h*entity*ereof grew the report, that the kings of this realme long times after were afraid to enter into the citie of Oxford.

<note place="marg"><date>756.</date></note>

 was in the 16 y*entity*ere of the emperor Constantinus, surnamed Copronimos, in the 6 y*entity*ere of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph> saith 755.</note>

 the reigne of Pipin king of France, and about the 22 y*entity*ere of Ethfine king of Scots. This Kinewulfe prooued a right woorthie and valiant prince, and was descended of the right line 

<note place="marg">The Britains vanquished.</note>

 of Cerdicus. He obteined great victories against the Britains or Welshmen, but at Bensington or Benton he lost a battell against Offa king of Mercia, in the 24 y*entity*ere of his reigne: and from that time forward tasting manie displeasures, at length through his owne follie came vnto a shamefull end. For whereas he had reigned a long time neither slouthfullie nor presumptuouslie, yet now as it were aduanced with the glorie of things passed, he either thought that nothing could gro against him, or else doubted the suertie of their state whom he should leaue behind him, ahd therefore he confined one Kineard the brother of Sigibert, whose fame he perceiued to increase more than he would haue wished.</p>
<p>This Kineard dissembling the matter, as he that could giue place to time, got him out of the countrie, and after by a secret conspiracie assembled togither a knot of vngratious companie, and returning priuilie into the countrie againe, watched his time, till he espied that the king with a small number of his seruants was come vnto the house of a noble woman, whome he kept *entity* paramour at Merton, wherevpon the said Kineard vpon the sudden beset the house round about. The king perceiuing himselfe thus besieged of his enimies, at the first caused the doores to be shut, supposing either by curteous woords to appease his enimies, or with his princelie authoritie to put them in feare.</p>
<p>But when he saw that by neither meane he could doo good, in a great chafe he brake foorth of the house vpon Kineard, and went verie n*entity*ere to haue killed him: but being compassed about with multitude of enimies, whilest he stood at defense, thinking it a dishonour 

<note place="marg">Kinewulfe slaine by conspirators.</note>

 for him to fl*entity*e, he was beaten downe and slaine, togither with those few of his seruants which he had there with him, who chose rather to die in s*entity*eking reuenge of their maisters death, than by cowardise to y*entity*eld themselues into the murtherers hands. There escaped none except one Welshman or Britaine, an hostage, who was neuerthelesse sore wounded and hurt.</p>
<p>The brute of such an heinous act was streightwaies-blowne ouer all, and brought with speed to the eares of the noble men and peeres of the realme, which were not farre off the place where this slaughter had b*entity*ene committed. Amongst other, one Osrike, for his age and wisedome accounted of most authoritie, exhorted the residue that in no wise they should suffer the death of their souereigne lord to passe vnpunished vnto their perpetuall shame and reproofe. Wherevpon in all hast they ran to the place where they knew to find Kineard, who at the first began to please his cause, to make large promises to pretend coosenage, and so foorth; but when he perceiued all that he could say or doo might not preuaile, he incouraged his companie to shew themselues valiant, and to resist their enimies to the vttermost of their powers. Heerevpon followed a doubtfull fight, the one part striuing to saue <pb n="651"/>their liues, and the other to atteine honour, and punish the slaughter of their souereigne lord. At length the victorie rested on the side where the right, so that the wicked murtherer after he had fought a while, at length was slaine, togither with fourescore and eight

 touching the receiuing of the faith or articles established by the Nicene councell, and obeieng of the other generall councels, with instructions concerning baptisme and k*entity*eping of synods y*entity*erelie, for the examination of priests and ministers, and reforming of naughtie liuers.

And that in no wise the chalice or paten were made of the horne of an oxe, bicause the same is bloudie of nature: nor the host of a crust, but of pure bread. Also whereas bishops vsed to sit in councels to judge in secular causes, they were now forbidden so to doo.</p>
<p>Manie other things were as meanes of reformation artlcled, both for spirituall causes, and also concerning ciuill ordinances, as disabling children to be heirs to the parents, which by them were not begot in lawfull matrimonie but on concubines, whether they were nunnes

 or secular woman. Also of paiment of tithes, performing of vowes, auoiding of vndecent apparell, and abolishing of all maner of heathenish vsages and customes that sounded contrarie to the order of christanitie, as curtailing of horsses, and eating of horsses flesh. These 

<note place="marg">Curtailing of horsses.</note>

 things with manie other expressed in 20 principall articles (as we haue said) were first concluded to be receiued by the church of the Northumbers in a councell holden there, and subscribed by Alfwold king of the Northumbers, by Delberike bishop of Hexham, by Eubald archbishop of Yorke, Higwald bishop of Lindisferne, Edelbert bishop of Whiterne, Aldulfe bishop of Mieth, Ethelwine also another bishop by his deputies, with a number of other of the clergie; and lords also of the temporaltie, as duke Alrike, duke Segwulfe, abbat Alebericke, and abbat Erhard. After this confirmation had of the Northumbers, there was also a councell holden in Mercia at Cealtide, in the which these persons subscribed, Iambert or Lambert archbishop of Canturburie, Offa king of Mercia, Hughbright bishop of Lichfield, Edeulfe bishop of Faron, with Vnwone bishop of Ligor, and nine other bishops, besides abbats; and thr*entity*e dukes, as Brorda, Farwald, and Bercoald, with earle Othbald.</p>

<p>AFTER Kenwulfe, one Britricus or Brightrike was ordeined king of Westsaxons, and began his reigne in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 787, which was about the 8 y*entity*ere of the gouernment of the empresse Eirene with hir son Constantinus, and about the second yeere of the reigne of Achaius K. of Scots. This Brightrike was descended of the line of Cerdicus the first king of Westsaxons, the 16 in number from him. He was a man of nature quiet *entity* temperate, more desirous of peace than of warre, and therefore he stood in doubt of the noble valiancie of one Egbert, which after succ*entity*eded him in the kingdome. The linage of Cerdicus was in that season so confounded and mingled, that euerie one as he grew in greatest power, stroue to be king and supreame gouernour. But speciallie Egbertus was knowne to be one that coueted that place, as he that was of the bloud roiall, and a man of great power <pb n="653"/>and lustie courage. King Brightrike therefore to liue in more safetie, banished him the land, 

<note place="marg">Egbert banished.</note>

 and appointed him to go into France. Egbert vnderstanding certeinlie that this his departure into a forreine countrie should aduance him in time, obeied the kings pleasure,.</p>
<p>About the third y*entity*ere of Brightrikes reigne, there fell vpon mens garments, as they 

<note place="marg">A strange woonder.</note>

 walked abroad, crosses of bloudie colour, and bloud fell from heauen as drops of raine. Some tooke this woonder for a signification of the persecution that followed by the Danes: 

<note place="marg"><emph>Mau. West. Wil. Malm. Hen. Hunt.</emph> Danes.</note>

 for shorthe after,, in the yeere insuing, there arriued thr*entity*e Danish ships vpon the English coasts, against whome the lieutenant of the parties adioining made foorth, to apprehend those that were come on land, howbeit aduenturing himselfe ouer rashlie amongst them, he was slaine: but afterwards when the Danes perceiued that the people of the countries about began to assemble, and were comming against them, they fled to their ships, and left their prey and spoile behind them for that time. These were the first Danes that arriued here in this land, being onelie sent (as was perceiued after) to view the countrie and coasts of the same to vnderstand how with a greater power they might, be able to inuade it, as shortlie after they did, and warned so with the Englishmen, that they got a great part of the land, and held in their owne possession. In the tenth y*entity*ere of king Brightrikes reigne, there were s*entity*ene in the aire firie dragons flieng, which betokened (as was thought) two grieuous plagues that followed. First a great dearth and famine: and secondlie a cruell war of the Danes, 

<note place="marg">Famin *entity* war signified.</note>

 which shortlie followed, as ye shall heare.</p>
<p>Finallie, after that Brightrike had reigned the space of 16 y*entity*eres, he departed this life, and was buried at Warham. Some write that he was poisoned by his wife Ethelburga 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Cest. lin.</emph> 5. <emph>cap.</emph> 25. Brightrike departed this life.</note>

 daughter vnto Offa king of Mercia (as before ye haue heard) and he maried hir in the fourth yere of his reigne. She is noted by writers to haue bin a verie euill woman, proud. and high-minded as Lucifer, and therewith disdainfull. She bare hir the more statelie, by reason of hir fathers great fame and magnificence: whome she hated she would accuse to 

<note place="marg">Ethelburga hir conditions and wicked nature.</note>

 hir husband, and so put them in danger of their liues. And if she might not so wreake hir rancour, she would not sticke to poison them.</p>
<p>It happened one day, as she meant to haue poisoned a yoong gentleman, against whome she had a quarell, the king chanced to tast of that cup, and died thereof (as before ye haue heard.) Hir purpose indeed was not to haue poisoned the king, but onelie the yoong gentleman, the which drinking after the king, died also,, the poison was so strong and vehement. For hir heinous crime it is said that the kings of the Westsaxons would not suffer

His vertues passed his fame: nothing he did that enuie could with iust cause reprooue. At home he shewed himselfe godlie and religious, in warre he became victorious, he restored the archbishops s*entity*e againe to Canturburie, wherein his humblenes

 was to be praised, that made no account of worldlie honour in his prouince, so that the order of the ancient canons might be obserued. He had wars left him as it were by succession from his predecessour Offa against them of Kent, and thervpon entring that countrie with a mightie armie, wasted and spoiled the same, and encountering in battell, with king Edbert or Ethelbert, otherwise called Prenne, ouerthrew his armie, and tooke him prisoner 

<note place="marg">The king of Keat taken prisoner.</note>

 in the field, but afterwards he released him to his great praise and commendation. For whereas he builded a church at Winchcombe, vpon the day of the dedication thereof, he <pb n="654"/>led the Kentish king as then his prisoner, vp to the high altar, and there set him at libertie, declaring thereby a great proofe of his good nature.</p>
<p>There were present at that sight, Cuthred whom he had made king of Kent in place of Ethelbert, or Edbert, with 18 bishops, and 10 dukes. The noise that was made of the people in reioising at the kings bountious liberalitie was maruellous. For not onelie he thus

 restored the Kentish king to libertie, but also bestowed great rewards vpon all the prelates and noble men that were come to the feast, euerie priest had a peece of gold, and euerie moonke a shilling. Also he dealt and gaue away great gifts amongst the people, and founded in that place an abbeie, indowing the same with great possessions. Finallie, after he had reigned 24 y*entity*eres, he departed this life, and appointed his buriall to be in the same abbeie of Winchcombe, leauing behind him a sonne named Kenelme, who succeeded his father in the kingdome, but was soone murthered by his vnnaturall sister Quendred, the 17 of Iulie, as hereafter shall be shewed.</p>

 Alred tooke vpon him the rule of that kingdom anno 788, and within one yeere was expelled, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Malth. West. Hen. Hunt. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 and left the kingdome to Ethelbert or Edelred as then reuoked out of exile, in which he had remained for the space of 12 y*entity*eres, and now being restored, he continued in gouernement of the Northumbers 4 y*entity*eres, or (as some say) 7 y*entity*eres; in the second y*entity*ere 

<note place="marg">Duke Ardulf taken and wounded.</note>

 whereof duke Eardulfe was taken and led to Ripon, and there without the gate of the monasterie wounded (as was thought) to death by the said king, but the moonks taking his bodie, and laieng it in a tent without the church, after midnight he was found aliue in the church.</p>
<p>Moreouer, about the same time the sonnes of king AIfwald were by force drawne out of the citie Yorke, but first by a wile they were trained out of the head church where they had taken sanctuarie, and so at length miserablie slaine by king Ethelbert in Wonwaldremere, 

<note place="marg"><date>792.</date></note>

 one of them was named Alfus, *entity* the other Alfwin. In the y*entity*ere of our Lord 792, Osred vpon trust of the others and promises of diuerse noble men, secretly returned into Northumberland, but his owne souldiers forsooke him, and so was he taken, and by king Ethelberts commandement put to death at Cunbridge on the 14 day of September.</p>
<p>The same y*entity*ere king Ethelbert maried the ladie Alfled the daughter of Offa king of Mercia, forsaking his former wife which he had, *entity* hauing no iust cause of diuorce giuen on hir part, wherby his people tooke such displeasure against him, that finallie after he had reigned now this second time 4 y*entity*eres, or (as other say) seuen y*entity*eres,, he could not auoid the destinie of his predecessors, but was miserablie killed by his owne subiects at Cobre, the 18 of Aprill. Afrer whome, one Oswald a noble man was ordeined king, and within 27 or 28 daies after <pb n="655"/>was expelled, and constreined to flie into the Ile of Lindesferne, and from thence vnto 

<note place="marg">Holie Iland Ardulfe.</note>

 the king of the Picts.</p>
<p>Then Ardulfe that was a duke and sonne to one Arnulfe was reuoked out of exile, made king, *entity* consecrated also at Yorke by the archbishop Cumhald, and thr*entity*e other bishops, the 25 of June, in y*entity*ere 396. About two yeeres after, to wit, in the y*entity*ere 798, one duke 

<note place="marg"><date>796.</date></note>

 Wade, and other conspirators which had beene also partakers in the murthering of king Ethelbert, raised warre against king Ardulfe, and fought a battell with him at Walleg, 

<note place="marg">Walalege.</note>

 but king Ardulfe got the vpper hand, and chased Wade and other his enimies out of the field. In the y*entity*ere 799, duke Aldred that had murthered Ethelbert or Athelred king of 

<note place="marg"><date>799.</date></note>

 Northumberland, was slaine by another duke called Chorthmond in reuenge of the death of his maister the said Ethelbert. Shortlie after, about the same time that Brightrike king of Westsaxons departed this life, there was a sore battell foughten in Northumberland at Wellehare, 

<note place="marg">The English men a afflicted each other with ciuill warre.</note>

 in the which Alricke the sonne of Herbert, and manie other with him were slaine but to rehearse all the battels with their successes and issues, it should be too tedious and irkesome to the readers, for the English people being naturallie hard and high-minded, continuallie scourged each other with intestine warres. About six or seuen y*entity*eres after this battell, king Ardulfe was expelled out of the state.</p>
<p>*entity* Thus ye may consider in what plight things stood in Northumberland, by the often seditions, tumults and changings of gouernors, so that there be which haue written, how after the death of king Ethelbert, otherwise called Edelred, diuers bishops and other of the chiefest nobles of the countrie disdaining such traitorous prince-killings, ciuill seditions, and iniurious dealings, as it were put in dailie practise amongst the Northumbers, departed out of their natiue borders into voluntarie exile, and that from thencefoorth there was not anie of the nobilitie that durst take vpon him the kinglie gouernement amongst them, fearing the fatall prerogatiue thereof, as if it had b*entity*ene Scians horsse, whose rider came euer to some euill end. But yet by that which is h*entity*eretofore shewed out of Simon Dunelm, it is euident, that there reigned kings ouer the Northumbers, but in what authoritie and power to command, it may be doubted.</p>
<p>Howbeit this is certeine, that the sundrie murtherings and banishments of their kings and dukes giue vs greatlie to gesse, that there was but sorie obedience vsed in the countries, whereby for no small space of time that kingdome remained without an head gouernor, being set open to the prey and iniurie of them that were borderers vnto it, and likewise vnto strangers. For the Danes, which in those daies were great rouers, had landed before in the 

<note place="marg">This chanced in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 700, as <emph>Simon Dun.</emph> saith.</note>

 north parts, *entity* spoiled the abbeie of Lindesferne otherwise called holie Iland, and perceiuing the fruitfulnesse of the countrie, and easinesse for their people to inuade it (bicause that through their priuate quarelling there was little publike resistance to be looked for) at their comming home, entised their countriemen to make voiages into England, and so landing in 

<note place="marg">The Danes inuade Northumberland.</note>

 Northumberland, did much hurt, and obteined a great part of the countrie in manner without resistance, bicause there was no ruler there able to raise anie power of men by publike authoritie to incounter with the common enimies, whereby the countrie was brought into great miserie, partlie with war of the Danes, and ciuill dissention amongest the nobles and people themselues, no man being of authoritie (I say) able to reforme such misorders. Yet we find that the nobles and capteines of the countrie assembling togither at one time against the 

<note place="marg">The Danes vanquished. This was in anuo 794, as <emph>Simon Dun.</emph> saith.</note>

 Danes that were landed about Tinmouth, constreined them by sharpe fight to fl*entity*e backe to their ships, and tooke certeine of them in the field, whose heads they stroke off there vpon the shore. The other that got to their ships, suffered great losse of men, and likewise of their vessels by tempest.</p>
<p>*entity* Here then we are taught that the safest way to monarchie, is when all degr*entity*es liue in loialtie. And that it is necessarie there should be one supereminent, vnto whome all the residue should stoope: this fraile bodie of ours may giue vs sufficient instruction. For reason ruleth in the mind as souereigne, and hath subiect vnto it all the affections and inward motions, yea the naturall actions are directed by hir gouernement: whereto if the will be obedient there cannot cr*entity*epe in anie outrage or disorder. Such should be the sole regiment <pb n="656"/>of a king in his kingdome; otherwise he may be called "Rex *entity* regendo, as Mons a mouendo." For there is not a greater enimie to that estate, than to roialtie, which as it is a readie way to cause a subuersion of a monarchie; so it is the shortest cut ouer to a disordered anarchie. But to proc*entity*ed in the historie.</p>
<p>After that Alrike (the last of king Witchreds sonnes, which reigned in Kent successiuelie after their father) was dead, the noble ofspring of the kings there so decaied, and began to vade awaie, that euerie one which either by flattering had got rithes togither, or by seditious partaking was had in estimation, sought to haue the gouernement, and to vsurp the title of king, abusing by vnworthie means the honor and dignitie of so high an office. Amongest 

<note place="marg">Edelbert.</note>

 others, one Edbert or Edelbert, surnamed also Prenne, gouerned the Kentishmen for the space of two yeares, and was in the end vanquished by them of Mercia, and taken prisoner, as before is said: so that for a time he liued in captiuitie, and although afterwards he was set at libertie, yet was he not receiued againe to the kingdome, so that it is vncerteine what end he made. Cuthred that was appointed by Kinevulfe the king of Mercia, to reigne in place of the same Edbert or Edelbert, continued in the gouernement eight y*entity*eres as king, rather by name than by act, inheriting his predecessors euill hap and calamitie, through faction and ciuill discord.</p>

<note place="marg">Lambert.</note>

<p>After that Iambrith or Lambert the archbishop of Canturburie was departed this life, one Edelred was ordeined in his place, vnto whome the primasie was restored, which in his predecessors time was taken awaie by Offa king of Mercia, as before is recited. Also after the death of Eubald archbishop of Yorke, another of the same name called Eubald the second was asmitted to succeed in that s*entity*e. After that Brightrike the king of Westsaxons was departed this life, messengers were sent with all sp*entity*ed into France, to giue knowledge thereof vnto Egbert, which as before is shewed, was constreined by the said Brightrike to depart the countrie. At the first, he withdrew vnto Offa king of Mercia, with whome he remained mained for a time, till at length (through suit made by Brightrike) he perceiued he might not longer continue there without danger to be deliuered into his enimies hands; and so Offa winking at the matter, he departed out of his countrie, and got him ouer into France. But being now aduertised of Brightriks death, and required by earnest letters sent from his friends to come and receiue the gouernement of the kingdome, he returned with all conuenient sp*entity*ed 

<note place="marg">Egbert receiued a king of Westsaxons His linage.</note>

 into his countrie, and was receiued immediatlie for king, by the generall consent of the Westsaxons, as well in respect of the good hope which they had conceiued of his woorthie qualities and aptnesse to haue gouernement, as of his roiall linage, being lineallie descended from Inigils the brother of king Inas, as sonne to Alkemound, that was the sonne of one Eaffa, which Eaffa was sonne to Ope the sonne of the foresaid Inigils.</p>

<p>King Egbert hauing ouercome his enimies of Wales and Cornewall, began to grow in authoritie aboue all the other rulers within this land, in somuch that euerie of them began to feare their owne estate, but namelie Bernulfe king of Mercia sore stomached the matter, as he that 

<note place="marg">Bernulf king of Mercia.</note>

 was wise, and of a loftie courage, and yet doubted to haue to doo with Egbert, who was knowen also to be a man both skilfull and valiant. At length yet considering with himselfe, that if his chance should be to speed well, so much the more should his praise be increased, he determined to attempt the fortune of warre, and therevpon intimated the same vnto Egbert, who supposing it should be a dishonor vnto him to giue place, boldlie prepared to m*entity*ete Bernulfe in the field. Herevpon they incountred togither at Ellendon, *entity* fought a sore 

<note place="marg">A battell fought at Ellendon.</note>

 battell, in the which a huge number of men were slaine, what on the one part, and on the other, but in the end the victorie remained with Egbert, although he had not the like host for 

<note place="marg">Egbert wan the victorie.</note>

 number vnto Bernulfe, but he was a politike prince, and of great experience, hauing chosen his souldiers of nimble, leane, and hartie men; where Bernulfs souldiers (through long ease) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 were cowardlie persons, and ouercharged with flesh. The battell was fought in the yeare of 

<note place="marg"><date>826</date></note>

 our Lord 826.</p>
<p>King Egbert hauing got this victorie, was aduanced into such hope, that he persuaded himselfe to be able without great adoo to ouercome the residue of his neighbours, whose estates he saw plainlie sore weakened and fallen into great decaie. Herevpon before all other, he determined to assaile Edelvulfe king of Kent, whome he knew to be a man in no estimation amongest his subiects. A competent armie therefore being leuied, he appointed his sonne Ethelwulfe *entity* Alstan bishop of Shireborne, with earle Walhard to haue the conduct therof, 

<note place="marg">Alstan bishop of Shireborn a warrior.</note>

 and sent them with the same into Kent, where they wrought such maisteries, that they chased both the king and all other that would not submit themselues, out of the countrie, constreining them to passe ouer the Thames. And herewith the Westsaxons following the victorie, 

<note place="marg">The conquests of the Westsaxons.</note>

 brought vnder subiection of king Egbert the countries of Kent, Essex, Southerie, and Sussex. The Eastangles also about the same time receiued king Egbert for their souereigne Lord and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hens. Hunt.</emph></note>

 comforted by his setting on against Bernulfe king of Mercia, inuaded the confines of his kingdome, in reuenge of displeasures which he had doone to them latelie before, by inuading their countrie, and as it came to passe, incountring with the said Bernulfe which came against 

<note place="marg">Bernulf king of Mercia slaine.</note>

 them to defend his countrie, they slue him in the field.</p>
<p>Thus their minds on both parts being kindled into further wrath, the Eastangles eftsoones in the yeare following fought with them of Mercia, and ouercame them againe, and slue their king Ludicenus, who succ*entity*eded Bernulfe in that kingdome, with 5 of his earles. The state of the kingdome of Mercia being weakened, Egbert conceiued an assured hope of good successe, *entity* in the 27 yeare of his reigne, made an open inuasion into the countrie, and chasing Whitlafe king of Mercia (that succ*entity*eded Ludicenus) out of his estate, conquered the whole kingdome of the Mercies. But yet in the y*entity*ere next following, or in the third yeare after, he restored it againe to Whitlafe, with condition, that he should inioy the same as tributarie to him, and acknowledge him for his supreme gouernour. The same yeare that Berulfe king

<note place="marg">These were the Cornish men as it to be supposed.</note>

 of Mercia was slaine by the Eastangles, there was a sore battell foughten at Gauelford, betwixt them of Deuonshire, and the Britains, in the which manie thousands died on both, parts.</p>
<p>King Egbert hauing conquered all the English people inhabiting on the south side of Humber, led foorth his armie against them of Northumberland: but the Northumbers being not onelie vexed with ciuill sedition, but also with the often inuasion of Danes, perceiued not 

<note place="marg">King Egbert inuadeth Northumberland. TheNorthumbers submit themselves to king Egbert.</note>

 how they should be able to resist the power of king Egbert: and therefore vpon good aduisement taken in the matter, they resolued to submit themselues, and therevpon sent ambassadors to him to offer their submission, committing themselues wholie vnto his protection. King Egbert gladlie receiued them, and promised to defend.them from all forren enimies. Thus the kingdome of Northumberland was brought vnder subiection to the kings of the Westsaxons, after the state had b*entity*en sore weakened with contention and ciuill discord that had continued amongst the nobles of the countrie, for the space of manie yeeres beside the in. uasion made by outward enimes, to the gr*entity*euous damage of the people.</p>
<p>After that king Egbert had finished his businesse in Northumberland, he turned his power 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph> Northwales and the eitie of Chester conquered by Egbert.</note>

 towards the countrie of Northwales, and subdued the same, with the citie of Chester, which till those daies, the Britains or Welshmen had kept in their possession. When king Egbert had obteined these victories, and made such conquests as before is mentioned, of the people h*entity*ere in this land, he caused a councell to be assembled at Winchester, and there by aduise of the high estates, he was crowned king, as souereigne gouernour and supreame lord of the whole land. It is also recorded, that he caused a commission to be directed foorth into all parts of the realme, to giue commandement, that from thence forward all the people inhabiting within this land, should be called English men, and not Saxons, and likewise the land should be 

<note place="marg">The name of this the when it was changed.</note>

 called England by one generall name, though it should app*entity*ere (as before is mentioned) that it was so called shortlie after the first time that the Angles and Saxons got possession thereof.</p>
<p>Now was king Egbert setled in good quiet, and his dominions reduced out of the troubles 

<note place="marg">The Danes.</note>

 of warre, when suddenlie newes came, that the Danes with a nauie of 35 ships, were arriued on the English coasts, and began to make sore warre in the land. K. Egbert being thereof aduertised, with all conuenient sp*entity*ed got togither an armie, and went foorth to giue battell to the enimies. Heerevpon incountring with them, there was a sore foughten field betwixt them, which continued with great slaughter on both sides, till the night came on, and then by chance of warre the Englishmen, which before were at point to haue gone awaie with victorie, 

<note place="marg">The Englishmen discomfited by Daues. <emph><unclear> .</unclear> Dun. H. Hnnt Malth. West.</emph></note>

 were vanquished and put to flight, yet king Egbert by couert of the night escaped his enimies hands; but two of his chiefe capteins Dudda and Osmond, with two bishops, to wit, Herferd of Winchester, and Vigferd of Shireborne, were slaine in that battell, which was foughten at Carrum, about the 834 of Christ, and 34 y*entity*ere of king Egberts reigne.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>834</date></note>

<p>In the yeere following, the Danes with their nauie came into Westwales, and there the Welshmen ioining with them, rose against king Egbert, but he with prosperous fortune vanquished

 to giue place vnto one Baldred, that tooke vpon him the gouernment, *entity* reigned the space of 18 y*entity*eres, without anie great authoritie, for his subiects regarded him but sorilie, so that in the end, when his countrie was inuaded by the Westsaxons, he was easilie constreined to depart into exile. And thus was the kingdome of Kent annexed to the kingdome of the Westsaxons, after the same kingdome had continued in gouernment of kings created of the same nation for the space of 382 y*entity*ers, that is to say, from the y*entity*ere of our Lord 464, vnto the

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>M </unclear> Westm.</emph></note>

Ashbert one day vnder a colour to haue the yoong king foorth on hunting, led him into a thicke wood, and there cut off the head from his bodie, an impe by reason of his tender y*entity*eres and innocent

<p>There hath gone a tale that bis death should be signified at Rome, and the place where 

<note place="marg"><emph>S*entity*e legends aurea fol.</emph> 165. in the life of S. Kenelme.</note>

 the murther was committed, by a strange manner: for (as they say) a white doue came and lighted vpon the altar of saint Peter, bearing a scroll in hir bill, which she let fall on the same altar, in which scroll among other things this was conteined, "In clenc kou bath, Kenelme kinbarne lieth vnder thorne, heaued bereaued:" that is, at Clenc in a cow pasture, Kenelme <pb n="660"/>the kings child lieth beheaded vnder a thorne. This tale I rehearse, not for anie credit I thinke it woorthie of, but onelie for that it s*entity*emeth to note the place where the yoong prince innocentlie lost his life.</p>

<note place="marg">Ceolwulfe K. of Mereia</note>

<p>After that Kenelme was thus made awaie, his vncle Ceolwulfe the brother of king Kenulfe was created king of Mercia, and in the second y*entity*ere of his reigne was expelled by Bernwulfe. 

<note place="marg"><date>823.</date></note>

 Bernwulfe in the third y*entity*ere of his reigne, was vanquished and put to flight in battell by Egbert king of Westsaxons, and shortlie after slaine of the Eastangles, as before ye haue heard. Then one Ludicenus or Ludicanus was created king of Mercia, and within two yeeres after came to the like end that happened to his predecessor before him, as he went about to reuenge his death, so that the kingdome of Britaine began now to r*entity*ele from their owne estate, and leane to an alteration, which grew in the end to the erection of a perfect monarchie, and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Mail. Westm.</emph></note>

 finall subuersion of their particular estates and regiments. After Ludicenus, succeeded Wightlafe, 

<note place="marg"><date>728.</date></note>

 who first being vanquisht by Egbert king of Westsaxons, was afterwards restored to the kingdome by the same Egbert, and reigned 13 yeeres, whereof twelue at the least were vnder tribute which he paied to the said Egbert and to his sonne, as to his souereignes and supreame gouernours. The kingdome of Northumberland was brought in subiection to the 

<note place="marg"><date>828.</date></note>

 kings of Westsaxons, as before is mentioned, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 828, and in the y*entity*ere of the reigne of king Egbert 28, but yet h*entity*ere it tooke not end, as after shall app*entity*ere.</p>

<note place="marg">ETHEL WULFUS.</note>

<p><hi rend="smallcap">ETHELWULFUS,</hi> otherwise called by some writers Athaulfus, began his reigne ouer the Westsaxons in the y*entity*ere 837, which was in the 24 y*entity*ere of the emperor Ludouicus Pius the was also K. of France, in the tenth y*entity*ere of Theophilus the emperor of the East, *entity* about the third y*entity*ere of Kenneth, the second of that name king of Scots. This Ethelwulfe minding in his youth to haue b*entity*ene a priest, entered into the orders as subdeacon, and as some write, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hentie Hunt. Matt. West.</emph></note>

 he was bishop of Winchester: but howsoeuer the matter stood, or whether he was or not, sure it is, that shortlie after he was absolued of his vowes by authoritie of pope Leo, and then maried a proper gentlewoman named Osburga, which was his butlers daughter. He was of nature courteous, and rather desirous to liue in quiet rest, than to be troubled with the gouernment 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Mules.</emph></note>

 of manie countries, so that contenting himselfe with the kingdome of Westsaxons, he permitted his brother Adelstan to inioy the residue of the countries which his father had subdued, as Kent and Essex, which other. He aided Burtbred the king of Mercia against the Welshmen, and greatlie aduanced his estimation, by giuing vnto him his daughter in mariage.</p>

<note place="marg">Foure especiall destructions of this land.</note>

<p>But now the fourth destruction which chanced to this land by forren enimies, was at hand: for the people of Denmarke, Norway, and other of those northeast regions, which in that season were great rouers by sea, had tasted the wealth of this land by such spoiles and preies as they had taken in the same, so that perceiuing they could not purchase more profit anie where else, they set their minds to inuade the same on ech side, as they had partlie begun in the daies of the late kings Brightrike and Egbert. The persecution vsed by these Danes 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun. Hen Hunt.</emph></note>

 s*entity*emed more gr*entity*euous, than anie of the other persecutions, either before or sitbens that time: for the Romans hauing quicklie subdued the land, gouerned it noblie without seeking the subuersion thereof. The Scots and Picts onelie inuaded the north parts. And the Saxons seeking the conquest of the land, when they had once got it, they kept it, and did what they could, to better and aduance it to a flourishing estate.</p>
<p>The Normans likewise hauing made a conquest, granted both life, libertie, and ancient lawes to the former inhabitants: but the Danes long time and often assailing the land on euerie side, now inuading it in this place, and now in that, did not at the first so much couet to conquer it, as to spoile it, nor to beare rule in it, as to waste and destroie it: who if they were at anie time ouercome, the victors were nothing the more in quiet: for a new nauie, and a greater 

<note place="marg">The Danes tought she destrumion of this laud.</note>

 armie was readie to make some new inuasion, neither did they enter all at one place, nor at once, but one companie on the east side, and an other in the west, or in the north and south coasts, in such sort, that the Englishmen knew not whether they should first go to make resistance against them.</p>

<pb n="661"/>
<p>This mischlefe began chieflie in the daies of this king Ethelwulfe, but it continued about the 

<note place="marg">How long the persecution of the Danes lasted. <emph>Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 space of two hundred yeeres, as by the sequele of this booke it shall app*entity*ere. King Ethelwulfe was not so much giuen to ease, but that vpon occasion for defense of his countrie and subiects, he was readie to take order for the beating backe of the enimies, as occasion serued, and speciallie chose such to be of his counsell, as were men of great experience and wisedome. Amongst other, there were two notable prelats, Suithune bishop of Winchester, and Adelstan 

<note place="marg">Two notable hithops in Ethelwulfs daies.</note>

 bishop of Shireborne, who were readie euer to giue him good aduise. Suithune was not so much expert in worldlie matters as Adelstan was, *entity* therefore chieflie counselled the king in things apperteining to his soules health: but Adelstan tooke in hand to order matters apperteining to the state of the commonwealth, as prouiding of monie, and furnishing foorth of men to withstand the Danes, so that by him manie things were both boldlie begun, and happilie atchiued, as by writers hath b*entity*ene recorded. He gouerned the s*entity*e of Shiroborne the space of 50 y*entity*eres, by the good counsell and faithfull aduise of those two prelats.</p>
<p>King Ethelwulfe gouerned his subiects verie politikelie, and by himselfe and his capteins oftentimes put the Danes to flight, though as chance of warre falleth out, he also receiued at their hands great losses, and sundrie sore detriments. In the first y*entity*ere of his reigne, the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun. Ilen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Danes arriued at Hampton, with 33 ships, against whome be sent earle Wulhard with part of his armie, the which giuing battell to the enimies, made great slaughter of them, and obteined 

<note place="marg">Danes discomfited. <emph>Nauh. West.</emph></note>

 a noble victorie. He sent also earle Adelhelme with the Dorsetshire men against an other number of the Danes, which were landed at Portesmouth, but after long fight, the said Adelhelme was slaine, and the Danes obteined the victorie. In the y*entity*ere following, earle Herbert 

<note place="marg">Englishmen put to flight. They are eftsoones vanquished.</note>

 fought against the Danes at Merseware, and was there slaine, and his men chased. The same yeere, a great armie of Danes passing by the east parts of the land, as through Lindsey, Eastangle, and Kent, slue and murtbered an huge number of people. The next y*entity*ere after this, they entered further into the land, and about canturburie, Rochesten, and London, did much mischiefe.</p>
<p>King Ethelwulfe in the fift y*entity*ere of his reigne, with a part of his armie incountred with the Danes at Carrum, the which were arriued in those parties with so ships, hauing their 

<note place="marg">Carrum.</note>

 full fraught of men, so that for so small a number of vessels, there was a great power of men of warre, in so much that they obteined the victorie at that time, and put the king to

 the woorse. About the tenth y*entity*ere of king Ethelwulfs reigne, one of his capteins called Ernwulfe, and bishop Adelstan, with the Summersetshioe men, and an other capteine called Osred, which the Dorsetshire men, fought against the Danes, at a place called Pedredesmuth, and vanquished them with great triumph. In the sixt*entity*enth yeere of his reigne, king Ethelwulfe 

<note place="marg"><date>851.</date></note>

 and his sonne Edelbald hauing assembled all their powers togither, gaue battell at Ocley, to an huge host of Danes, the which with foure hundred and fiftle ships had arriued 

<note place="marg">Ocley Two hundred and fiftie ships saith <emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 at Thames mouth, and destroied the famous cities of London and Canturburie, and also had chased Brightwulfe king of Mercia in battelh and being now entered into Southerie, were incountered by king Ethelwulfe at Ocley aforesaid, *entity* after sore fight and incredible slaughter made on both sides, in the end, the victorie by the power of God was gluen to those that bel*entity*eued on him, and the losse rested with great confusion to the miscreants.</p>
<p>Thus king Ethelwulfe obteined a glorious victorie in so mightie a battell, as a greater had

 not beene hghtlie heard of to chance within the English dominions. The same yeere also Athelstan king of Kent and duke Ealbere fought by sea with the Danes, and tooke 9 of their ships, and chased the residue. Moreouer, one earle Ceorle hauing with him the power of Deuonshire, fought with the Danes at Winleshore, and got the victorie. This ye*entity*re was

 verie luckie to the English nation, but yet the armie of the Danes lodged all the winter season in the Ile of Tenet.

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

<p>In the 18 yeere of king Ethelwulfes reigne, he aided Burthred king of Mercia against 

<note place="marg"><date>859.</date></note>

 the Welshmen (as before is mentioned) and gaue to him his daughter in marriage, the solemnization whereof was kept at Chipnham. The same y*entity*ere king Ethelwulfe sent his sonne Alured as then but fiue yeeres of age to Rome, where he was consecrated K. by pope Leo the fourth, and was receiued of him as if he had beene his owne sonne. Duke Ealhere or Eachere with the Kentishmen, and one Huda or rather Wada, with 

<note place="marg">Great slaughter of Danes at Tenet.</note>

 the men of Southerie, fought against the armie of Danes at Tenet, where great slaughter was made on both sides the Englishmen preuailing in the beginning, but in the end, both their foresaid dukes or leaders died in that battell, beside manie other that were slaine and drowned.</p>
<p>In the 19 y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Ethelwulfe ordeined that the tenths or tithes of all lands due to be paid to the church, should be fr*entity*e from all tribute, duties, or seruices regall. And afterwards, with great deuotion he went to Rome, where he was receiued with great honour, and taried there one whole y*entity*ere: he tooke with him his sonne Alured, who had

 b*entity*ene there before as ye haue heard. He repaired the Saxons schoole, which Offa king of Mercia had sometime founded in that citie, and latelie had b*entity*ene sore decaied by fire. He confirmed the grant of Peter pence, to the intent that no Englishmen from thence-foorth 

<note place="marg">King Ethelwulfs liberalitie to churches. <emph>Will. Malmes. Simon Dun.</emph> Mancusae.</note>

 should doo penance in bounds as he saw some there to doo before his face. It is also written that he should acquit all the churches of his realme of paieng tribute to his coffers (as before ye haue heard) *entity* moreouer couenanted to send vnto Rome euerie y*entity*ere three hundred marks, that is to say, one hundred marks to saint Peters church, an other hundred marks to saint Paules light, and the third hundred marks to the Pope.</p>

<note place="marg">The lndie Iudith.</note>

<p>In his returne thorogh France, he married the ladie Iudith, daughter to Charles the bald, then K. of France., and bringing hir with him into his countries, placed hir by him in a chaire of estate, with which d*entity*ed he offended so the minds of his subiects, bicause it was against the order taken before him, for the offense of Ethelburga, that his sonne Ethelbald and Adelstan bishop of Shireborne, with Enwulfe earle of Summerset, conspired to depose him 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil Molm.</emph></note>

 from his kinglie authoritie, but by mediation of friends, the matter was taken vp, and so ordered, that the kingdome was diuided betwixt the father and the sonne, with such parcialitie, that the sonne had the better part lieng westward, and the father was constreined to content himselfe with the east part being the woorst.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>857.</date></note>

<p>Of this trouble of Ethelwulfe some write otherwise, after this manner word for word. *entity* Ethelwulfe king of the Westsaxons being returned from, Rome *entity* the parties beyond the seas, was prohibited the entrance into his realme by Adelstane bishop of Shireborne, and Ethelbald his eldest sonne; pretending outwardlie the coronation of Alfride, the mariage of ludith the French kings daughter, and open eating with hir at the table, to be the onelie cause of this their manifest rebellion.

Touching this Ethelred, he was in time of peace a most courteous prince, and one that by all kind of meanes sought to win the hears of the people: but abroad in the warres he was sharpe and sterne, as he that vnderstood what apperteined to good order, so that he would suffer no offense to escape vnpunished. By which meanes he was famous both in peace and warre: but he neither liued any long time in the gouernement, nor yet was suffered to passe the short space that he reigned in rest and quietnesse.</p>

<note place="marg">Foure y*entity*eres six moneths saith <emph>Harison. Wil. Malm.</emph> Ethelred fought with the Danes nine times in one y*entity*ere.</note>

<p>For whereas he reigned not past six yeeres, he was continuallie during that tearme vexed with the inuasion of the Danes, and speciallie towards the latter end, insomuch that (as hath b*entity*ene reported of writers) he fought with them nine times in one y*entity*ere: and although with diuers and variable fortune, yet for the more part he went away with the victorie. Beside that, he oftentimes lay in wait for their forragers, and such as straied abroad to rob and spoile the countrie, whom he met withall and ouerthrew. There were slaine in his time nine earles of those Danes, and one king, beside other of the meaner sort without number.</p>
<p>But here is to be vnderstood, that in this mean time, whilest Ethelred was busied in warre to resist the inuasions of the Danes in the south and west parts of this land, the kings <pb n="665"/>and and rulers of Mercia and Northumberland taking occasion therof, began to withdraw their

 eouenanted subiection from the Westsaxons, and tooke vpon them as it were the absolute gouernment and rule of their countries, without respect to aid one another, but rather were contented to susteine the enimies within their dominions, than to preuent the iniurie with dutifull assistance to those, whom by allegiance they were bound to serue and obeie.</p>
<p>By reason hereof, the Danes. without resistance grew into greater power amongst them, 

<note place="marg">The Danes grow in puissance.</note>

 whilest the inhabitants were still put in feare each day more than other, and euerie late gotten victorie by the enimies by the increase of prisoners, ministred occasion of some other conquest to follow. Euen about the beginning of Ethelreds reigne. there arriued vpon the English coasts an huge armie of the Danes, vnder the conduct of two renowmed capteins Hnngar 

<note place="marg">Hungar and Vbba.</note>

 and Vbba, men of maruellous strength and valiancie, but both of them passing cruell of nature. They lay all the winter season in Estangle, compounding with them of the countrie for truce vpon certeine conditions, sparing for a time to shew their force for quietnesse sake.</p>
<p>In the second y*entity*ere of king Ethelred. the said capteins came with their armies into Yorkshire, finding the country vnprouided of necessarie defense bicause of the ciuill discord that reigned among the Northumbers, the which had latelie expelled king Osbright, that had the

 gouernement of those parts, and placed one Ella in his roome: howbeit now they were constreined to reuoke him home againe, and sought to accord him and Ella. But it was long yer that might be brought to passe, notwithstanding yet at length they were made friends, by reason of this inuasion attempted by forren enimies and then raising their powers they came to Yorke, where the Danes, hauing wasted the countrie euen to the riuer of Tine, were lodged.</p>
<p>The English bost entring the citie, began to fight with the Danes, by reason whereof a sore battell insued betwixt them: but in the end the two kings Osbright and Ella were

 slaine, and a great number of the Northumbers, what within the citie, and what without lost their liues at that time, the residue were constreined to take truce with the Danes. This battell was fought the 21 day of March being in Lent, on the Friday before Palmsunday, in the yere 657.</p>
<p>*entity* Some haue written otherwise of this battell, reporting that the Northumbers calling home king Osbright (whome before they had banished) incountred with the Danes in the field, without the walles of Yorke, but they were easilie beaten backe, and chased into the citie, the which by the Danes pursuing the victorie. was set on fier and burnt, togither with the king and people that were fled into in for succour. How soeuer it came about, certeine it is, that the Danes got the victorie, and now hauing subdued the Northumbers, appointed one Egbert to reigne ouer them as king, vnder their protection, which Egbert reigned in that sort six yeares ouer those which inhabited beyond the riuer of Tine. In the same yeare, Adelstane bishop of Shireborne departed this life, hauing gouerned that s*entity*e the terme of 50 yeares. This Adelstane was a man of high wisedome, and one that had borne no small rule

 and put to flight, losing one of their kings (that is to say) Basreeg or Osreeg, and 5 earles, Sidroc the elder, and Sidroc. the yoonger,, Osberne, Freine, and Harold. This battell was sore foughten and continued till night with the slaughter of manie thousands of Danes.

 of these warres which king Ethelred had with the Danes: for he maketh mention of one, Iuarus a king of the Danes, who landed (as he writeth) at the mouth of Humber, and like a stout enimie inuaded the countrie adioining, Against whome Ethelred with his brother Alured came with an armie, and incountring the Danes, fought with them by the space of a whole day togither, and was in danger to haue b*entity*en put to the woorse, but that the night seuered them asunder. In the morning they ioined againe: but the death of Iuarus, who chanced to be slaine in the beginning of the battell, discouraged the Danes, so that they were easilie put to flight, of whome (before they could get out of danger) a great number 

<note place="marg">Danes put to flight.</note>

 were slaine. But after that they had recouered themselues togither, and found out a conuenient place where to pitch their campe, they chose to their capteines Agnerus, and Hubba, 

<note place="marg">Agnerus and Hubba.</note>

 two brethren, which indeuored themselues by all meanes possible to repaire their armie: so that within 15 daies after the Danes eftsoones fought with. the Englishmen, and gaue them such an ouerthrow, that little wanted of making an end of all incounters to be attempted after by the Englishmen.</p>
<p>But yet within a few dales after this, as the Danes attended their market to spoile the countrie and range somewhat licentiouslie abroad, they fell within the danger of such ambushes as were laid for them by king Ethelred, that no small slaughter was made of them, but yet not without some losse of the Englishmen. Amongest others, Ethelred himselfe receiued a wound. whereof he shortlie after died. Thus saith Polydor touching the warres which king Ethelred had with the Danes, who yet confesseth (as the trueth is) that such authors as he herein followed, varie much from that which the Danish writers doo record of these matters, and namelie touching the dooings of luarus, as in the Danish, historic you may s*entity*e more at large.</p>

<note place="marg">Eglevdon.</note>

 monasterie was builded by one bishop Aswin, and changing the name of the place, it was after called saint Edmundsburie. Thus was king Edmund put to death by the cruell Danes for his constant confessing the name of Christ, in the 16 yeare of his reigne, and so ceased, the kingdome of Eastangles.

 is to be remembred, that some writers rehearse the cause to be this.

Wherevpon the king of Denmarke, glad to haue so iust a quarell against them of Northumberland, furnished foorth an armie, and sent the same by sea (vnder the leading of his two brethren Hungar and Hubba) into Northumberland, where they slue first the said king Osbright, and after king Ella, at a place besides Yorke, which vnto this day is called Ellas croft, taking that name of the said Ella, being there slaine in defense of his countrie against the Danes.

<note place="marg">Repton.</note>

 Torkseie. In the yeare following, the same Halden inuaded Mercia, and wintered at Ripindon. There were come to him thr*entity*e other leaders of Danes which our writers name to be 

<note place="marg">Eurthred king of Mercie.</note>

 kings, Godrun, Esketell, *entity* Ammond, so that their power was greatlie increased. Burthred <pb n="669"/>king of Mercia which had gouerned that countrie by the space of 22 y*entity*eres, was not able to withstand the puissance of those enimies: wherevpon he was constreiued to auoid the countrie, and went to Rome, where he departed this life, and was buried in the church of our ladie, n*entity*ere to the English schoole.</p>
<p>In the fourth yeare of king Alured the armie of the Danes diuided it selfe into two parts, 

<note place="marg"><date>875.</date></note>

 so that king Halden with one part thereof went into Northumberland, and lay in the winter 

<note place="marg">The Danes went into Nonhumbeland.</note>

 season n*entity*ere to the riuer of Time, where hee diuided the countrie amongest his men, and remained there for the space of two yeares, and oftentimes fetched thither bootiet and preies out of the countrie of the Picts. The other part of the Danish armie with the thr*entity*e foresaid kings or leaders came vnto Cambridge, and remained there a whole yeare. In the same 

<note place="marg">The Danes at Cambridge,.</note>

 yeare king Alured fought by sea with 7 ships of Danes, tooke one of them, *entity* chased the 

<note place="marg"><date>876.</date></note>

 residue. In the yeare next insuing, the Danes came into the countrie of the Westsaxons, and king Alured tooke truce with them againe, and they sware to him (which they had not 

<note place="marg">The Danes tooke an oth. <emph>Hen. Hund.</emph></note>

 vsed to doo to anie afore that time) that they would depart the countrie. Their armie by sea sailing from Warham toward Excester, susteined great losse by tempest, for there perished 120 ships at Swanewicke.</p>
<p>Moreouer the armie of the Danes by land went to Excester in breach of the truce, and 

<note place="marg">The Danes went to Ex cester.</note>

 king Alured followed them, but could not ouertake them till they came to Excester, and there he approched them in such wise, that they were glad to deliuer pledges for performance of such counmants as were accorded betwixt him and them. And so then they departed 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hear. Hunt.</emph></note>

 out of the countrie, and drew into Mercia. But shortlie after, when they had the whole gouernment of the land, from Thames northward, they thought it not good to suffer king alured to continue in rest with the residue of the countries beyond Thames. And therefore the thr*entity*e foresaid rulers of Danes, Godrun, Esketell, and ammond, inuading the countrie of Westaxons came to Chipnam, distant 17 miles from Bristow, *entity* there pitched 

<note place="marg"><date>877.</date></note>

 their tents.</p>
<p>King Alured aduertised hereof, hasted thither, and lodging with his armie n*entity*ere to the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor,</emph></note>

 enimies, prouoked them to battell. The Danes perceiuing that either they must fight for their liues, or die with shame, boldlie came foorth, and gaue battell. The Englishmen rashlie incountered with them, and though they were ouermatched in number, yet with such violence they gaue the onset, that the enimies at the first were abashed at their hardie assaults. But when as it was perceiued that their slender ranks were not able to resist the thicke leghers of the enimies, they began to shrinke *entity* looke backe one vpon an other, and so of force were constreined to retire: and therewithall did cast themselues into a ring, which though it s*entity*emed to be the best way that could be deuised for their safetie. yet by the great force and number of their enimies on each side assailing them, they were so thronged togither on heaps, that they had no roome to stir their weapons. Which disaduantage notwithstanding, they slue a great number of the Danes, and amongest other, Hubba the brother of Agner, with 

<note place="marg">Hubba slain<unclear></unclear></note>

 manie other of the Danish capteins. At length the Englishmen hauing valiantlie foughten a long time with the enimies, which had compassed them about, at last brake out and got them to their campe. To be briefe, this battell was foughten with so equall fortune, that no 

<note place="marg">The victorie doubtfull.</note>

 man knew to whether part the victorie ought to be ascribed. But after they were once seuered, they tooke care to cure their hurt men, and to burie the dead bodies, namelie the Danes interred the bodie of their capteine Hubba with great funerall pompe and solemnitie: which doone, they held out their iournie till they came to Abington, whither the English 

<note place="marg">Abington.</note>

 armie shortlie after came also, and incamped fast by the enimies.</p>
<p>In this meane while, the rumor was spread abroad that king alured had b*entity*ene discomfited by the Danes, because that in the last battell he withdrew to his campe. this turned greatlie to his aduantage: for thereby a great number of Englishmen hasted to come to his succour. On the morrow after his comming to Abington, he brought his armie readie to 

<note place="marg">The Danes and Englishmen fight n*entity*er to Abington.</note>

 fight into the field: neither were the enimies slacke on their parts to receiue the battell, and so the two armies ioined and fought verie sore on both sides: so that it s*entity*emed the Englishmen <pb n="670"/>had not to doo with those Danes, which had b*entity*ene diuerse times before discomfited and put to flight, but rather with some new people fresh and lustie. But neither the one part nor the other was minded to giue ouer: in so much that the horssemen alighting on foot, and putting their horsses from them, entered the battell amongst the footmen, and thus they continued with equall aduantage till night came on, which parted the affraie, being one of the 

<note place="marg">Vncerteine victorie Thus farre <emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 sorest foughten fields that had beene heard of in those daies. To whether partie a man might iustlie attribute the victorie, it was vtterlie vncerteine, with so like losse *entity* gaine the matter was tried *entity* ended betwixt them. With the semblable chance of danger and glorie seuen 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph></note>

 times that y*entity*ere did the English and Danes incounter in battell, as writer s haue recorded. 

<note place="marg">A peace agreed vpon.</note>

 At length, when their powers on both parts were sore diminished, they agr*entity*ed vpon a peace, with these conditions, that the Danes should not attempt anie further warre against the Englishmen, nor bring into this land anie new supplie of souldiers out of Denmarke. But this peace by those peacemakers was violated and broken, in so much as they ment nothing lesse than to fall from the conceiued hope which they had of bearing rule in this land, and of inriching themselues with the goods, possessions, rents and reuenues of the inhabitants.

<note place="marg">Ann. 876. saith <emph>Simou Dun.</emph></note>

<p>ABOUT the same time, or shortlie after, there came into England one Rollo, a noble man of Denmarke or Norway, with or Norway, with a great armie, and (notwithstanding the peace concluded between the Englishmen and the Danes) began to waste and destroy the countrie. King Alured hearing these newes, with all sp*entity*ed thought best in the beginning to stop such a common mischiefe, and immediatlie assembling his people, went against the enimies, and gaue them battell, in the which there died a great number of men on both sides, but the greater losse fell to Rollo his armie. Yet Matthew Westmin. saith that the Englishmen were put to flight. After this, it chanced that Rollo being warned in dreame, left England, *entity* sailed ouer into France, where he found fortune so fauourable to him, that he obteined in that

 region for him and his people a countrie, the which was afterwards named Normandie, of those northerne people which then began to inhabit the same, as in the histories of France you maie s*entity*e more at large.</p>
<p>The Danes which had concluded peace with king Alured (as before you haue heard) shortlie after, vpon the first occasion, brake the same, and by often inuasion which they made into 

<note place="marg">King Alured driuen to his shifts.</note>

 the countrie of Westsaxons, brought the matter to that passe, that there remained to king Alured but onelie the three countries of Hamshire, Wiltshire, *entity* Summersetshire, in so much that he was constreined for a time to k*entity*epe himselfe close within the fennes and maresh grounds <pb n="671"/>of Summersetshire, with such small companies as he had about him, constreined to get their liuing with fishing, hunting and other such shifts. He remained for the, most part within an Ile called Edlingsey, that is to say, the Iland of noble men, enuironed about with fennes 

<note place="marg">Edlingsey</note>

 and mareshes.</p>
<p>Whiles he was thus shut vp within this Iland, he was by dreame aduertised of better hap 

<note place="marg">A vision if it be true.</note>

 shortlie to follow: for as it hath b*entity*ene said, saint Cuthbert app*entity*ered to him as he laie in sl*entity*epe, and comforted him, declaring to him, that within a while fortune should so turne, that he should recouer againe his kingdome to the confusion of his enimies. And to assure him that this should prooue true, he told him that his men which were gone abroad to catch fish, should bring home great plentie, although the season was against them by reason that the waters were frosen, and that a cold rime fell that morning, to the hinderance of their purpose His mother also at that time being in sleepe, saw the like vision. And as they had dreamed, so it came to passe: for being awakened out of their sleepe, in came his men with so great foison of fish, that the same might haue sufficed a great armie of men or the vittelling of them at that season.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, king Alured tooke vpon him the habit of a minstrell, and going foorth of 

<note place="marg">King Alured disguiseth himselfe. <emph>Polytler Fabian.</emph></note>

 his closure, repaired to the campe of the Danish king, onelie accompanied with one trustee seruant, and tarrieng there certeine daies togither, was suffered to go into euerie part, and plaie on his instrument, as well afore the king as others, so that there was no secret, but that he vnderstood it. Now when he had s*entity*ene and learned the demeanour of his enimies, he returned againe to his people at Edlingsey, and there declared to his nobles what he had S*entity*ene and heard, what negligence was amongst the enimies, and how easie a matter it should be for him to indamage them. Wherevpon they conceiuing a maruellous good hope, and imboldened with his words, a power was assembled togither, and spies sent foorth to learne and bring woord where the Danes lodged: which being doone, and certificat made accordinglie, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hemr. Hunt.</emph></note>

 king Alured comming vpon them on the sudden, slue of them a great number, 

<note place="marg"><date>877.</date></note>

 hauing them at great aduantage.</p>
<p>About the same time the brother of king Halden came with thirtie and three ships out of 

<note place="marg"><date>878.</date></note>

 Wales into the countrie of Westsaxons, on the coast of Deuonshire, where the Deuonshire 

<note place="marg"><emph>Malth. West.</emph></note>

 men gaue him battell, and slue him with 840 persons of his retinue. Other write, that Halden himselfe was present at this conflict, with Inguare, otherwise called Hungar, and that they were both slaine there. with twelue hundred of their companie (before a certeine 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon, Dun.</emph></note>

 castell called Kinwith; receiuing as they had deserued for their cruell dealing latelie by them practised in the parties of Southwales, where they had wasted all afore them with fire and swoord not sparing abbeies more than other common buildings.</p>
<p>King Alured being with that good lucke the more comforted, builded a fortresse in the Ile of Edlingsey, afterwards called Athelney, and breaking out oftimes vpon the enimies, 

<note place="marg">Athelney.</note>

 distressed them at sundrie times with the aid of the Summersetshire men, which were at hand. About the seuenth w*entity*eke after Easter, in the seuenth y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Alured went to Eglerighston, on the east part of Selwood, where there came to him the people of Summersetshire, Wiltshire, *entity* Hamshire, reioising greatlie to s*entity*e him abroad. From thence he went to Edanton, *entity* there fought against the armie of the Danes', and chased them

 vnto their strength, where he remained afore them the space of fouret*entity*ene daies. Then the armie of the Danes deliuered him hostages and couenants to depart out of his dominions, and that their king should be baptised, which was accomplished: for Gurthrun, whome some name Gurmond, a prince or king amongst these Danes, came to Alured and was baptised king Alured receiuing him at the fontstone, named, him Adelstan and gaue to him the countrie of Eastangle, which he gouerned (or rather spoiled) by the space of twelue y*entity*eres.</p>
<p>Diuerse other of the Danish nobilitie to the number of thirtie (as Simon Dunelmensis saith) came at the same time in companie of their king Gurthrun, and were likewise be baptised, on wh*entity*me king Alured bestowed manie rich gifts. At the same time (as is to be thought) was <pb n="672"/>the league concluded betwixt king Alured and the said Gurthrun. or Gurmond, in wich bounds of king Alureds kingdome are set foorth thus: "First therefore let the bounds or marshes of our dominion stretch vnto the riuer of Thames, and from thence to the water of L*entity*e euen vnto the head of the same water, and so foorth streight vnto Bedford: and finallie going alongst by the riuer of Ouse, let them end at Watlingstr*entity*et."</p>
<p>This league being made with the aduise of the same sage personages as well English as those that inhabited within east England, is set foorth in maister Lamberts booke of the old English lawes, in the end of those lawes or ordinances which were established by the same king Alured, as in the same booke ye may s*entity*e more at large.</p>

 well furnished with men of warre into Eastangle, the which at the mouth of the riuer called Sture, incountering with 16 ships of the Danes, set vpon them, and ouercame them in fight: but as they returned with their prises, they incountered with another mightie armie of the enimies, and fighting with them were ouercome and vanquished.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>889.</date></note>

<p>In the yeere following, king Alfred besieged the citie of London, the Danes that were within fled from thence, and the Englishmen that were inhabitants thereof gladlie receiued 

<note place="marg">London recouered out of the hands of the Daues.</note>

 him, reioising that there was such a prince bred of their nation, that was of power able to reduce them into libertic.

 armie of those Danes *entity* Normans, which had b*entity*ene in France, returned into England, and arriued in the hauen or riuer of Limene in the east part of Kent, n*entity*ere to the great wood called Andredesley, which did conteine in times past 120 miles in length, and thirtie in breadth. These Danes landing with their people builded a castle at Appledore.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>893.</date></note>

<p>In the meane time came Hasting with 80 ships into the Thames, and builded a castle at

 Middleton, but he was constreined by siege which king Alfred planted about him, to receiue an oth that he should not in any wise annoie the dominion of king Alfred, who vpon his promise to depart, gaue great grits as well to him as to his wife and children. One of his sonnes also king Alfred held at the fontstone, and to the other duke Aldred was god father. For (as it were to win credit and to auoid present danger) Hasting sent vnto Alfred these his two sonnes, signifieng that if it stood with his pleasure, he could be content that they should be baptised. But neuerthelesse this Hasting was euer most vntrue of word and d*entity*ed, he builded a castle at Beamfield. And as he was going foorth to spoile and wast the kings

 countries, Alfred tooke that castle. with his wife children, ships and goods, which he got togither of such spoiles as he had abroad: but he restored vnto Hasting his wife and children, bicause he was their godfather.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, newes came that a great number of other ships of Danes were come out of Northumberland, and had besieged Excester Whilest king Alfred went then against them, the other armie which lay at Appledore inuaded Essex, and built a castell in that countrie, and after went into the borders of Wales, and builded another castell neere vnto the riuer of Seuerne but being driuen out of that countrie, they returned againe into Essex. Those 

<note place="marg">Seuerne.</note>

 that had besieged Excester, vpon knowledge had of king Alfreds comming, fled to their ships, and so remaining on the sea, roaued abroad, s*entity*eking preles. Besides this, other armies there were sent foorth, which comming out of Northumberland tooke the citie of Chester, 

<note place="marg">Chester taken by Danes. Great famine.</note>

 but there they were so beset about with their enimies, that they were constreined to eate their horsses. At length, in the 24 y*entity*ere of king Alfred, they left that citie, and fetcht a compass about Northwales, and so meaning to saile round about the coast to come into Northumberland, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hon. Hunt.</emph></note>

 they arriued in Essex, and in the winter following drew their ships by the Thames into the water of Luie. That armie of Danes which had besieged Excester, tooke preies 

<note place="marg">The water of luie, now L*entity*e.</note>

 about Chichester, and was met with, so that they lost manie of their men, and also diuerse of their ships.</p>
<p>In the y*entity*ere following, the other armie which had brought the ships into the riuer Luie, began to build a castell n*entity*ere to the same riuer, twentie miles distant from London: but the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hon. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Londoners came thither, and giuing battell to the Danes, slue foure of the chiefe capteins. 

<note place="marg">The Londoners victors against the Danel.</note>

 But by Simon Dunel. and Matt. Westm. it should seeme, that the Londoners were at this time put to flight, and that foure of the kings barons were slaine in fight. Howbeit Henrie Hunt. hath written as before I haue recited; and further saith, that when the Danes fled for their refuge to the castell, king Alfred caused the water of Luie to be diuided into thr*entity*e chanels, so that the Danes should not bring backe their ships out of the place where they laie at anchor. When the Danes perceiued this, they left their ships behind them, and went into the borders of Wales, where at Carbridge vpon Seuerne they built another castell, and 

<note place="marg">Cartbridge as <unclear>Wak bridge</unclear>.</note>

 lay there all the winter following, hauing left their wiues and children in the countrie of Eastangles. King Alfred pursued them, but the Londoners tooke the enimies ships, and brought some of them to the citie, and the rest they burnt.</p>
<p>Thus for the space of thr*entity*e y*entity*eres after the arriuing of the maine armie of the Danes in the hauen of Luie, they sore indamaged the English people, although the Danes themselues susteined more losse at the Englishmens hands than they did to them with all pilfering and spoiling. In the fourth y*entity*ere after their comming, the armie was diuided, so that one part 

<note place="marg">The Danish armie diuided into parth</note>

 of them went into Northumberland, part of them remained in the countrie of Eastangles, *entity* <pb n="674"/>another part went into France. Also certeine of their ships came vpon the coast of the Westsaxons, oftentimes setting their men on land to rob and spoile the countrie. But king Alfred tooke order in the best wise he might for defense of his countrie and people, and caused certeine mightie vessels to be builded, which he appointed foorth to incounter with the enimies ships.</p>

<note place="marg">The death of king Alfred.</note>

<p>Thus like a worthie prince and politike gouernor, he preuented each way to resist the force of his enimies, and to safegard his subiects. Finallie after he had reigned 29 y*entity*res and an halfe, he departed this life the 28 day of October. His bodie was buried at Winchester:

By this deuise he brought his countrie into good tranquillitie, so that he caused bracelets of gold to be hanged vp aloft on hils where anie common waies lay, to s*entity*e if anie durst be so hardie to take them away by stealth. He was a liberall prince namely in relieuing of the poore. To churches he confirmed such priuileges as his father had granted before him, and he also sent rewards by way of deuotion vnto Rome, and to the bodie of saint Thomas in India. Sighelmus the bishop of Shireborne bare the same, and brought from thence rich stones, and sw*entity*et oiles of inestimable valure. From Rome also he brought a p*entity*ece of the holy crosse which pope Martinus did send for a present vnto king Alfred.</p>
<p>Moreouer king Alfred founded three goodlie monasteries, one at Edlingsey, where he 

<note place="marg">Foundation of monasteries.</note>

 liued sometime when the Danes had bereaued him almost of all his kingdome, which was after called Athelney, distant from Taunton in Sumersetshire about fiue miles: the second he builded at Winchester, called the new minster: and the third at Shaftesburie, which was an house of nuns, where he made his daughter Ethelgeda or Edgiua abbesse. But the foundation of the vniuersitie of Oxford passed all the residue of his buildings, which he began by the good exhortation and aduise of Neotus an abbat, in those daies highlie est*entity*emed for his vertue and lerning with Alfred. This worke he tooke in hand about the 23 y*entity*ere of his reigne, which was in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 895. So that the vniuersitie of Cambridge was founded 

<note place="marg"><date>895.</date></note>

 before this other of Oxford about 265 yeeres, as Polydor gathereth. For Sigebert king of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> The vniuersitie of Oxford erected.</note>

 the Eastangles began to erect that vniuersitie at Cambridge about the y*entity*ere of our Lord 630.</p>
<p>King Alfred was learned himselfe, and giuen much to studie, insomuch that beside diuerse good lawes which he translated into the English toong, gathered togither and published, he also translated diuerse other bookes out of Latine into English, as <emph>Ososius, Pastorale Gregorij, Beda de gestis Anglorum, Boetius de consolatione philosophiae,</emph> and the booke of Psalmes; but this he finished not, being preuented by death. So this worthie prince minded well toward the common wealth of his people, in that season when learning was little est*entity*emed amongst the west nations, did studie by all meanes possible to instruct his subiects in the trade of leading 

<note place="marg">The vertuous seale of Alured to bring his people to an honest trade of life. He is persuaded by his mother, to applie himselfe to learning.</note>

 an honest life, and to incourage them generallie to imbrace learning. He would not suffer anie to beare office in the court, except he were learned: and yet he himselfe was twelue y*entity*eres of age before he could read a word on the booke, and was then trained by his mothers persuasion to studie, promising him a goodlie booke which she had in hir hands, if he would learne to read it.</p>
<p>Herevpon going to his booke in sport, he so earnestlie set his mind thereto, that within a small time he profited maruellouslie, and became such a fauorer of learned men, that he delighted most in their companie, to haue conference with them, and allured diuerse to come vnto him out of other countries, as Asserius Meneuensis bishop of Shirborne, *entity* Werefridus 

<note place="marg">Asserius Meneuensis Werefridus. Iohn Scot.</note>

 the bishop of Worcester, who by his commandement translated the bookes of Gregories dialogs into English. Also I. Scot, who whiles he was in France translated the book of Dionysius Ariopagita, intituled <emph>Hierarchia,</emph> out of Gr*entity*eke into Latine, and after was schoolemaister in the abbeie of Malmesburie, and there murthered by his scholers with penkniues. He had diuerse other about him, both Englishmen *entity* strangers, as Pleimond afterward archbishop of Canturburie, Grimbald gouernor of the new monasterie at Winchester, with others.</p>

<note place="marg">Grimbald.</note>

<p>But to conclude with this noble prince king Alured, he was so carefull in his office, that he 

<note place="marg">Alured diuided the time for his necessarie <unclear>v </unclear></note>

 diuided the 24 houres which conteine the day and night, in thr*entity*e parts, so that eight houres he spent in writing, reading, and making his praiers, other eight he emploied in relieuing his bodie with meat, drinke and sl*entity*epe, and the other eight he bestowed in dispatching of businesse concerning the gouernement of the realme. He had in his chapell a candle of 24 parts, whereof euerie one lasted an houre: so that the sexton, to whome that charge was committed, by burning of this candle warned the king euer how the time passed away. A little before his death, he ordeined his last will and testament, bequeathing halfe the portion of all his goods 

<note place="marg">His last will and testament.</note>

 iustlie gotten, vnto such monasteries as he had founded. All his rents and reuenues he diuided into two equall parts, and the first part he diuided into thr*entity*e, bestowing the first vpon his seruants in houshold, the second to such labourers and workemen as he kept in his works of <pb n="676"/>sundrie new buildings, the third part he gaue to strangers. The second whole part of his reuenues was so diuided, that the first portion thereof was dispersed amongst the poore people of his countrie, the second to monasteries, the third to the finding of poore scholers, and the fourth part to churches beyond the sea. He was diligent in inquirie how the iudges of his land behaued themselues in their iudgements, and was a sharpe corrector of them which transgressed in that behalfe. To be briefe, he liued so as he was had in great fauour of his neighbours, *entity* highlie honored among strangers. He maried his daughter Ethelswida or rather Elstride vnto Baldwine earle of Flanders, of whome he had two sonnes Arnulfe and Adulfe, the first succ*entity*eding in the erledome of Flanders, and the yoonger was made earle of Bullogne.</p>
<p>The bodie of king Alured was first buried in the bishops church; but afterwards, because the Canons raised a fond tale that the same should walke a nights, his sonne king Edward remoued it into the new monasterie which he in his life time had founded. Finallie, in memorie of him a certeine learned clarke made an epitath in Latine, which for the woorthinesse thereof is likewise (verse for verse, and in a maner word for word) translated by Abraham Fleming into English, whose no litle labor hath b*entity*ene diligentlie imploied in supplieng sundrie insufficiences found in this huge volume.</p>

<p>In the daies of the foresaid king Alured, the kingdome of Mercia tooke end. For after that the Danes had expelled king Burthred, when he had reigned 22 yeares, he went to Rome, and there died, his wife also Ethelswida, the daughter of king Athulfe that was sonne to king Egbert followed him, and died in Pauia in Lumbardie. The Danes hauing got the 

<note place="marg">Cewulfe.</note>

 countrie into their possession, made one Cewulfe K. thereof, whome they bound with an oth and deliuerie of pledges, that he should not longer k*entity*epe the state with their pleasure, and <pb n="677"/>further should be readie at all times to aid them with such power as he should be able to make. This Cewulfe was the seruant of king Burthred. Within foure yeares after the Danes returned, and tooke one part of that kingdome into their owne hands, and left the residue vnto Cewulfe. But within a few yeares after, king Alured obteined that part of Mercia which Cewulfe ruled, as he did all the rest of this land, except those parcels which the Danes held, as Northumberland, the countries of the Eastangles, some part of Mercia, and other.</p>
<p>The yeare, in the which king Alured thus obteined all the dominion of that part of Mercia, which Cewulfe had in gouernance, was after the birth of our Sauiour 886, so that the 

<note place="marg"><date>886.</date></note>

 foresaid kingdome continued the space of 302 yeares vnder 22 kings, from Crida to this last 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 Cewulfe. But there be that account the continuance of this kingdome, onelie from the beginning of Penda, vnto the last yeare of Burthred, by which reckoning it stood not past 270 yeares vnder 18, or rather 17 kings, counting the last Cewulfe for none, who began his reigne vnder the subiection of the Danes, about the yeare of our Lord 874, where Penda began his reigne 604.</p>
<p>The Eastangles and the Northumbers in these daies were vnder subiection of the Danes, as partlie may be perceiued by that which before is rehearsed. After Guthrun that gouerned the 

<note place="marg">Gurthrun K. of the eastangles died 990.</note>

 Eastangles by the terme of 12 yeares, one Edhirike or Edrike had the rule in those parts, a Dane also, and reigned 14 yeares, and was at length bereued of his gouernement by king 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 Edward the sonne of king Alured, as after shall appeare. But now, although that the Northumbers were brought greatlie vnder foot by the Danes, yet could they not forget their old 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 accustomed maner to stirre tumults and rebellion against their gouernours, insomuch that in 

<note place="marg"><date>872.</date></note>

 the yeare 872, they expelled not onelie Egbert, whome the Danes had appointed king ouer 

<note place="marg">Egbert king of Northumberland expelied from his kingdome. Egbert d*entity*parted this life. Ricsig.</note>

 one part of the countrie (as before you haue heard) but also their archbishop Wilfehere. In the yeare following, the same Egbert departed this life, after whome one Rigsig or Ricsige succ*entity*eded as king, and the archbishop Wolfehere was restored home.</p>
<p>In the same yeare the arme of Danes which had wintered at London, came from thence into Northumberland, and wintered in Lindseie, at a place called Torkseie, and went the next 

<note place="marg">The Danes winter in Lindseie.</note>

 yeare into Mercia. And in the yeare 975, a part of them returned into Northumberland, as before ye haue heard. In the yeare following, Ricsig the king of Northumberland departed this life: after whome an other Egbert succ*entity*eded. And in the yeare 988, the armie of the 

<note place="marg"><date>975.</date></note>

 Danes meaning to inhabit in Northumberland, and to settle themselues there, chose Guthrid 

<note place="marg">Ricsig departed this life.</note>

 the sonne of one Hardicnute to their king, whome they had sometime sold to a certeine widow at Witingham. But now by the aduise of an abbat called Aldred, they red*entity*emed his libertie, 

<note place="marg"><date>983.</date></note>

 and ordeined him king to rule both Danes and Englishmen in that countrie. It was said, 

<note place="marg">Guthred ordeined king of Northumberland.</note>

 that the same Aldred being abbat of holie Iland, was warned in a vision by S. Cuthberd, to giue counsell both to the Danes and Englishmen, to make the same Guthrid kin. This chanced about the 13 yeare of the reigne of Alured king of Westsaxons.</p>
<p>When Guthrid was established king, he caused the bishops see to be remoued from holie 

<note place="marg">The bishops s*entity*e remooued fr*entity* holie iland to Chester in the str*entity*et.</note>

 Iland vnto Chester in the str*entity*et, and for an augmentation of the reuenues and iurisdiction belonging thereto, he assigned and gaue vnto saint Cuthbert all that countrie which lieth betwixt the riuers of Teise and Tine. *entity* Which christian act of the king, liuing in a time of palpable blindnesse and mistie superstition, may notwithstanding be a light to the great men and p*entity*eres of this age (who pretend religion with zeale, and professe (in shew) the truth with feruencie) not to impouerish the patrimonie of the church to inrich themselues and their posteritie, not to pull from bishoprikes their ancient reuenues to make their owne greater, not to alienate acclesiasticall liuings into temporall commodities, not to seeke the conuersion of college lands into their priuat possessions; not to intend the subuersion of cathedrall churches to fill their owne cofers, not to ferret out concealed lands for the supports of their owne priuat lordlines; not to destroy whole towneships for the erection of one statelie manour; not to take and pale in the commons to inlarge their seueralles; but like good and gratious common-wealth-men, in all things to preferre the peoples publike profit before their owne gaine <pb n="678"/>and glorie, before their owne pompe and pleasure, before the satisfieng of their owne inordinate desires.</p>

<note place="marg">Priuiledges granted to S. Cuthberts shrine.</note>

<p>Moreouer, this priuiledge was granted vnto saint Cuthberts shrine: that whosoeuer fled vnto the same for succour and safegard, should not be touched or troubled in anie wise for the space of thirtie, *entity* seuen daies. And this freedome was confirmed not onelie by king Guthrid, but also by king Alured. Finallie king Guthrid departed this life in the yeare of our Lord 

<note place="marg"><date>894.</date></note>

 894, after he had ruled the Northumbers with much crueltie (as some say) by the terme of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor. Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 11 yeares, or somewhat more. He is named by some writers Gurmond, and also Gurmo, *entity* thought to be the same whome king Alured caused to be baptised. Whereas other affirme, that Guthrid, who ruled the Eastangles, was he that Alured receiued at the fontstone: 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph> Sithrike.</note>

 William Malmesburie taketh them to be but one man, which is not like to be true. After this Guthrid or Gurmo his sonne Sithrike succeeded, and after him other of that line, till king Adelstane depriued them of the dominion, and tooke it into his owne hands.</p>

<note place="marg">EDWARD THE ELDER.</note>

<p>AFTER the deceasse of Alured, his sonne Edward surnamed the elder began his reigne ouer the more part of England, in the yeare of our Lord 901, which was in the second yeare 

<note place="marg"><date>901.</date></note>

 of the emperor Lewes, in the eight yeare of the reigne of Charles surnamed Simplex king of France, and about the eight yeare of Donald king of Scotland. He was consecrated after the maner of other kings his ancestors by Athelred the archbishop of Canturburie. This Edward was not so learned as his father, but in princelie power more high and honorable, for he ioined the kingdome of Eastangles and Mercia with other vnto his dominion, as after shall be shewed, and vanquished the Danes, Scots, and Welshmen, to his great glorie and high commendation.</p>
<p>In the beginning of his reigne he was disquieted by his brother Adelwold, which tooke the 

<note place="marg">Winborne</note>

 towne of Winborne besides Bath, and maried a nun there, whome he had defloured, *entity* attempted manie things against his brother. Wherevpon the king came to Bath, and though Adelwold shewed a countenance as if he would haue abidden the chance of warre within

 Winborne, yet he stole awaie in the right, and fled into Northumberland, where he was ioifullie receiued of the Danes. The king tooke his wife being left behind, and restored hir to the house from whence she was taken. *entity* Some haue written, that this Adelwold or Ethelwold was not brother vnto king Edward, but his vncles sonne.</p>
<p>After this, king Edward prouiding for the suertie of his subiects against the forraies, which the Danes vsed to make, fortified diuers cities and townes, and stuffed them with great garrisons 

<note place="marg">The English nation practised in wars, go commonlie awaie with the victorie.</note>

 of souldiers, to defend the inhabitants, and to expell the enimies. And suerlie the Englishmen were so invred with warres in those daies, that the people being aduertised of the inuasion <pb n="679"/>of the enimies in anie part of their countrie, would assemble oftentimes without knowledge of king or capteine, and setting vpon the enimies, went commonlie awaie with victorie, by reason that they ouermatched them both in number and practise. So were the enimies despised of the English souldiers, and laughed to scorne of the king for their foolish attempts. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunl.</emph></note>

 Yet in the third yeare of king Edwards reigne, Adelwold his brother came with a nauie of Danes into the parties of the Eastangles, and euen at the first the Essex men yeelded themselues 

<note place="marg">Essex y*entity*elded to Adelwold.</note>

<p>King Edward awakened h*entity*erewith assembled his people, and followed the enimies, wasting 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 all the countries betwixt the riuer of Ouse and saint Edmunds ditch. And when he should returne, he gaue commandement that no man should staie behind him, but come backe togither for doubt to be forelaid by the enimies. The Kentishmen notwithstanding this ordinance 

<note place="marg">The Kentishmen disobeying the kings commandement, are surprised by the enimies. Adelwold king Edwards brother.</note>

 and commandement, remained behind, although the king sent seuen messengers for them. The Danes awaiting their aduantage, came togither, and fiercelie fought with the Kentishmen, which a long time valiantlie defended themselues. But in the end the Danes obteined the victorie, although they lost more people there than the Kentishmen did: and amongst other, there were slaine the foresaid Adelwold, and diuerse of the chiefe capteins amongst the Danes. Likewise of the English side, there died two dukes, Siwolfe *entity* Singlem or Sigbelme, with sundrie other men of name, both temporall and also spirituall lords and abbats. In the fift y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Edward concluded a truce with the Danes of Eastangle and Northumberland at Itingford. But in the y*entity*ere following, he sent an armie against them of Northumberland, which slue manie of the Danes, and tooke great booties both of people and 

<note place="marg">Fortie daies saith <emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 cattell, remaining in the countrie the space of fiue weekes.</p>
<p>The y*entity*ere next insuing, the Danes with a great armie entered into Mercis, to rob *entity* spcile the countrie, against whome king Edward sent a mightie host, assembled togither of the Westsaxons *entity* them of Mercia, which set vpon the Danes, as they were returning homeward, and slue of them an huge multitude, togither with their chiefe capteins and leaders, as king Halden, and king Eolwils, earle Vter, earle Scurfa, and diuerse other. In the y*entity*ere 912, or (as 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Simon Dunel. saith) 908, the duke of Mercia Edred or Etheldred departed this life, and then king Edward seized into his hands the cities of London and Oxford, and all that part of Mercia which he held. But afterwards he suffered his sister Elfleda to inioy the most part thereof, except the said cities of London and Oxford, which he still reteined in his owne hand. This Elfleda was wife to the said duke Edred or Etheldred, as before you haue heard: of whose woorthie acts more shall be said heereafter.</p>
<p>In the ninth y*entity*ere of his reigne, king Edward built a castell at Hertford, and likewise he builded a towne in Essex at Wightham, and lay himselfe in the meane time at Maldon, otherwise 

<note place="marg">Wighthem.</note>

 Meauldum, bringing a great part of the countrie vnder his subiection, which before was subiect to the Danes. In the y*entity*ere following, the armie of the Danes departed from Northampton and Chester in breach of the former truce, and slue a great number of men at 

<note place="marg">Chester, or <unclear> ther L , as  thinks. Dig  </unclear></note>

 Hochnerton in Oxfordshire. And shortlie after their returne home, an other companie of them went foorth, and came to Leighton, where the people of the countrie being assembled togither, fought with them *entity* put them to flight, taking from them all the spoile which they had got, and also their horsses.</p>
<p>In the 11 y*entity*ere of king Edward, a fleet of Danes compassed about the west parts, *entity* came to the mouth of Seuerne, and so tooke preies in Wales: they also tooke prisoner a Welsh bishop named Camelgaret, at Irchenfield, whome they led to their ships: but king Edward 

<note place="marg">Irchenfield.</note>

 red*entity*emed him out of their hands, paieng them fortie pounds for his ransome. After that the armie of Danes went foorth to spoile the countrie about Irchenfield, but the people of Chester, Hereford, and other townes and countries thereabout assembled togither, and giuing battell to the enimies, put them to flight, and slue one of their noble men called earle <pb n="680"/>

<note place="marg">Danes discomsted.</note>

 Rehald, and Geolcil the brother of earle Vter, with a great part of their armie, *entity* draue the residue into a castell, which they besieged till the Danes within it gaue hostages, and couenanted to depart out of the kings land. The king caused the coasts about Seuerne to be watched, that they should not breake into his countrie: but yet they stale twise into the borders: neuerthelesse they were chased and slaine as manie as could not swim, and so get to their ships. 

<note place="marg">The Ile of Stepen. Deomedun. Danes saile into Ireland.</note>

 Then they remained in the Ile of Stepen, in great miserie for lacke of vittels, bicause they could not go abroad to get anie. At length they departed into North wales, and from thence sailed into Ireland.</p>
<p>The same y*entity*ere king Edward came to Buckingham with an armie, and there taried a whole moneth, building two castels, the one vpon the one side of the water of Ouse, and the other 

<note place="marg">Turketillus an earle.</note>

 vpon the other side of the same riuer. He also subdued Turketillus an earle of the Danes that dwelt in that countrie, with all the residue of the noble men and barons of the shires of Bedford and Northampton. In the 12 y*entity*ere of king Edwards reigne, the Kentishmen and Danes fought togither at Holme: but wheither partie had the victorie, writers haue not declared. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 Simon Dunelm. speaketh of a battell which the citizens of Canturburie fought against a number of Danish rouers at Holme, where the Danes were put to flight, but that should be (as he noteth) 8 y*entity*eres before this supposed time, as in the y*entity*ere 904, which was about the third y*entity*ere of king Edwards reigne.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Anno</emph> 911. <emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

<p>After this, other of the Danes assembled themselues togither, and in Staffordshire at a place called Tottenhall fought with the Englishmen, and after great slaughter made on both parties, the Danes were ouercome: and so likewise were they shortlie after at Woodfield or Wodenfield. And thus king Edward put the Danes to the woorse in each place commonlie where he came, and hearing that those in Northumberland ment to breake the peace: he inuaded 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor</emph> Ericks king of Eastangles.</note>

 the countrie, and so afflicted the same, that the Danes which were inhabitants there, gladlie continued in rest and peace. But in this meane time, Ericke the king of those Danes which held the countrie of Eastangle, was about to procure new warre, and to allure other of the Danes to ioine with him against the Englishmen, that with common agr*entity*ement they might set vpon the English nation, and vtterlie subdue them.</p>
<p>King Edward hauing intelligence h*entity*ereof, purposed to preuent him, and therevpon entering 

<note place="marg">King Edward inuadeth the countrie of the Eastangles.</note>

 with an armie into his countrie, cruellie wasted and spoiled the same. King Ericke hauing alreadie his people in armor through displeasure conceiued heereof, and desire to be reuenged, hasted foorth to incounter his enimies: and so they met in the field, and fiercelie assailed 

<note place="marg">Ericke put to flight.</note>

<p>After the deceasse of Elfleda, king Edward tooke the dominion of Mercia (as before we haue said) into his owne hands, and so disherited his n*entity*ece Alfwen or Elswen, the daughter of Elfeda, taking hir awaie with him into the countrie of Westsaxons. By this meanes he so amplified the bounds of his kingdome, that he had the most part of all this Iland of Brtaine at his commandement: for the kings of the Welshmen: namelie the king of Strercled, and of the Scots, acknowledging him to be their chiefe souereigne lord, and the Danes in Northumberland were kept so short, that they durst attempt nothing against him in his latter daies: so that he had time to applie the building and reparing of cities, townes, and castels, wherein he so much delighted. He builded a new towne at Notingham on the southside of Trent, and made a bridge ouer that riuer betwixt the old towne and the new. he also repared Manchester beyond the riuer of Mercia in Lancashire, accounted as then in the south end of Northumberland, and he built a towne of ancient writers called Thilwall, neere to the same riuer of Mercia, and placed therein a garrison of souldiers: diuerse other townes and 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hear. Hunt.</emph></note>

 castels he built, as two at Buckingham on either side of the water of Ouse (as before is shewed) and also one at the mouth of the riuer of Auon. He likewise built or new repared the townes of Tocetor and Wigmore, with diuerse other, as one at Glademuth, about the last y*entity*ere of his reigne. Some also he destroied which s*entity*emed to serue the enimies turne for harborough, as a castell at Temnesford, which the Danes builded and fortified.</p>
<p>At length, after that this noble prince king Edward had reigned somewhat aboue the tearme of 23 yeeres, he was taken out of this life at Faringdon: his bodie was conueied from thence vnto Winchester, and there buried in the new abbeie. He had thr*entity*e wiues, or (as some haue 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 written) but two, affirming that Edgiua was not his wife, but his concubine, of whome he begat his eldest sonne Adelstan, who succeeded him in the kingdome. This Edgiua (as hath b*entity*ene

<p>Heerevpon when she came to ripe y*entity*eres, king Edward by chance comming to the place where she was remaining, vpon the first sight was streight rauished with hir beautie (which in d*entity*ed excelled) that she could not rest till he had his pleasure of hir, and so begot of hir the <pb n="683"/>foresaid Adelstan: by hir he had also a daughter that was maried vnto Sithrike a Dane and K. of Northumberland. The Scotish writers name hir Beatrice, but our writers name hir 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West. Polydor.</emph></note>

 Editha. His second or rather his first wife (if he were not maried to Eguina mother to Adelstan) was called Elfleda or Elfrida, daughter to one earle Ethelme, by whom he had issue; to wit, 

<note place="marg">The issue of K. Edward.</note>

 two sonnes Ethelward and Edwin, which immediatlie departed this life after their father, and six daughters, Elfleda, Edgiua, Ethelihilda, Ethilda, and Elfgiua. Elfleda became a nun, and Ethelhilda also liued in perpetuall virginitie, but yet in a laie habit.</p>

Edgiua and Elgiua were sent by their brother Adelstan into Germanie, vnto the emperor Henrie, who bestowed one of them vpon his sonne Otho, that was after emperor, the first of that name; and the other vpon a duke inhabiting about the Alpes: by his last wife named Edgiua, he had also two sonnes, Edmund *entity* Eldred, the which both reigned after their brother Adestan successiuelie. Also he had by hir two daughters, Edburge that was made a nun, and Edgiue a ladie of excellent beautie, whom hir brother Adelstan gaue in mariage vnto Lewes king of Aquitaine.</p>
<p>Whilest this land was in continuall trouble of warres against the Danes, as before is touched, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. High. Wil. Malm. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 small regard was had to the state of the church, in somuch that the whole countrie of the Westsaxons by the space of seuen y*entity*eres togither (in the daies of this king Edward) remained without anie bishop, to take order in matters apperteining to the church. Wherevpon the pope 

<note place="marg">England from accurssed.</note>

 had accurssed the English people, bicause they suffred the bishops sees to be vacant so long a time. King Edward to auoid the cursse, assembled a prouinciall councell, 905, in the which 

<note place="marg">Anno 905.</note>

 the archbishop of Canturburie Pleimond was president. Wherein it was ordeined, that whereas the prouince of Westsaxons in times past had but two bishops, now it should be diuided into fiue diocesses, euerie of them to haue a peculiar bishop.</p>
<p>When all things were ordered and concluded in this synod (as was thought requisite) the archbishop was sent to Rome with rich presents, to appease the popes displeasure. When the pope had heard what order the king had taken, he was contented therewith. And so the archbishop returned into his countrie, and in one day at Canturburie ordeined seuen bishops, as fiue to the prouince of Westsaxons, that is to say, Fridestane to the s*entity*e of Winchester, Adelstan to

 S. German in Cornwall, Werstan to Shireborne, Adelme to Welles, and Edulfe to Kirton. Also to the prouince of Sussex he ordeined one Bernegus, and to Dorchester for the prouince of Mercia one Cenulfus.</p>
<p>*entity* Hcere ye must note, that where William Malme. Polychro. and other doo affirme, that pope Formosus did accursse king Edward and the English nation, for suffering the bishops sees to be vacant, it can not stand with the agreement of the time, vnlesse that the cursse pronounced by Formosus for this matter long afore was not regarded, vntill Edward had respect thereto. For the same Formosus began to gouerne the Romane see about the y*entity*ere of our

 came to the crowne. But how so euer this matter maie fall out, this ye haue to consider: although that Pleimond was sent vnto Rome to aduertise the pope what the king had decr*entity*ed *entity* doone, in the ordeining of bishops to their seuerall s*entity*es, as before ye haue heard, yet (as maister Fox hath noted) the gouernance and direction of the church depended chieflie vpon the kings of this land in those daies, as it manifestlie appeereth, as well by the decrees of king Alfred, as of this king Edward, whose authoritie in the election of bishops (as before ye haue heard) seemed then alone to be sufficient.</p>
<p>Moreouer, I thinke it good to aduertise you in this place, that this Pleimond archbishop of Canturburie (of whome ye haue heard before) was the 19 in number from Augustine the first archbishop there: for after Brightwold that was the 8 in number, and first of the English nation that gouerned the s*entity*e, succeeded Taduin, that sat three yeeres, Notelin fiue yeeres, Cuthbert <pb n="684"/>18 y*entity*eres, Breth win thr*entity*e y*entity*eres, Lambert 27 y*entity*eres, Adelard 15 y*entity*eres, Wilfred 28 y*entity*eres, Theologildus or Pleogildus 3 y*entity*eres, Celuotus or Chelutus 10 y*entity*eres.

<note place="marg"><date>924.</date></note>

This Adelstane was crowned and consecrated king at Kingstone vpon Thames, of Aldelme the archbishop of Canturburie, who succ*entity*eded Pleimond. He was the 24 king in number from Cerdicus or Cerdike the first king of the Westsaxons. There were 

<note place="marg">Alfred striueth in vaine to k*entity*epe Adelstane from the gouernment. <emph>Wil. Malm.</emph> See more hereof in the acts and monuments set foorth by <emph>M. Fox,</emph> vol. 1. leafe 195.</note>

 in the beginning some that set themselues against him as one Alfred a noble man, which practised by treason to haue kept him from the gouernement: but he was apprehended yer the he could bring his purpose to passe, and sent to Rome there to trie himselfe giltie or not giltie. And as he tooke his oth for his purgation before the altar of saint Peter, he suddenlie fell downe to the earth, so that his seruants tooke him vp, and bare him into the English schoole or hospitall, where the third night after he died.</p>
<p>Pope Iohn the tenth sent vnto king Adelstane, to know if he would that his bodie should be laid in Christian buriall or not. The king at the contemplation of Alfreds friends and kinsfolks, signified to the pope that he was contented that his bodie should be interred amongst other christians. His lands being forfeited were giuen by the king vnto God and saint Peter. The cause that mooued Alfred and other his complices against the king, was (as some haue alledged) his bastardie. But whether that allegation were true or but a slander this is certeine that except that steine of his honor, there was nothing in this Adelstane worthie of blame: so that he darkened all the glorious fame of his predecessors, both in vertuous conditions and victorious triumphs. Such difference is there to haue that in thy selfe wherein to excell, rather than to stand vpon the woorthinesse of thine ancestors, sith that can not rightlie be called a mans owne.</p>
<p>After that king Adelstane was established in the estate, he indeuored himselfe to answer the expectation of his people; which hoped for great wealth to insue by his noble and prudent 

<note place="marg"><emph>Anno</emph> 996. <emph>Simon Dun. Dalydor.</emph></note>

 gouernance. First therfore meaning to prouide for the suertie of his countrie, he concluded a peace with Sithrike king of the Northumbers, vnto, whome (as ye haue heard) he gaue one of his sisters named Editha in mariage. Sithrike liued not past one y*entity*ere after he had 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Mdlm.</emph></note>

 so maried hir. And then Adelstane brought the prouince of the Northumbers vnto his subiection, expelling one Aldulph out of the same that rebelled against him. There be that <pb n="685"/>write, that Godfrie and Aulafe the sonnes of Sithrike succ*entity*eding their father in the gouernement of Northumberland, by practising to mooue warre against king Adelstane, occasioned him to inuade their countrie, and to chase them out of the same, so that Aulafe fled into Ireland, *entity* Godfrie into Scotland: but other write, that Godfrie was the father of Reignold 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 which wan Yorke, after that Sithrike had slaine his brother Nigellus, as before is mentioned.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hect Botlius.</emph> The Scotish writers varis from our English authors. Beatrice daughter to K. Edward as the Scotish writers say. Edwin was nep brother to K. Edward but son to him. Adelstane flieth the realme.</note>

 chronicles affirme, that in the life time of king Edward, his daughter Beatrice was giuen in mariage to Sithrike, the gouernor of the Danes in Northumberland, with condition that if anie male were procreated in that mariage, the same should inherit the dominions of king Edward after his decease. King Edward had a brother (as they say) named Edwin, a iolie gentleman, and of great estimation amongst the Englishmen. He by Sithrikes procurement was sent into Flanders in a ship that leaked, and so was drowned, to the great reioising of all the Danes, least if he had suruiued his brother, he would haue made some business for the crowne.</p>
<p>About the same time Adelstane a base sonne of K. Edward fled the realme, for doubt to be made away by some like traitorous practise of the Danes. Shortlie after, king Edward vnderstanding that Sithrike went about some mischiefe toward him, persuaded his daughter to poison hir husband the said Sithrike. Then Aulafe or Aualassus, and Godfrie the sonnes of Sithrike, finding out by diligent examination, that Beatrice was of counsell in poisoning hir husband, they caused hir to be apprehended and put to death on this wise. She was set 

<note place="marg">Beatrice put to death by hir steptons.</note>

 naked vpon a smithes cold anuill or stithie, and therewith hard rosted egs being taken out of the hot imbers were put vnder hir armepits, and hir armes fast hound to hir bodie with a cord, and so in that state she remained till hir life passed from hir. King Edward in reuenge of his daughters death mooued warre against the two brethren, Aulafe and Godfrie, and in battell finallie vanquished them, but was slaine in the same battell himselfe.</p>
<p>Thus haue the Scotish chronicles recorded of these matters, as an induction to the warres which followed betwixt the Scots and Danes as confederates against king Adelstane: but the truth thereof we leaue to the readers owne iudgement. For in our English writers we find no such matter, but that a daughter of king Edward named Edgitha or Editha, after hir fathers deceasse was by hir brother king Adelstane, about the first y*entity*ere of his reigne, giuen in mariage (as before ye haue heard) vnto the foresaid Sithrike king of Northumberland, that was descended of the Danish bloud, who for the loue of the yoong ladie, renounced his heathenish religion and became a christian; but shortlie after, forsaking both his wife and the christian faith, he set vp againe the worshipping of idols, and within a while after, as an apostara miserablie ended his life. Whervpon the yoong ladie, hir virginitie being 

<note place="marg">Editha a virgine.</note>

 preserued, and hir bodie vndefiled (as they write) passed the residue of hir daies at Polleswoorth in Warwikeshire, spending hir time (as the same writers affirme) in fasting, watching, praieng, and dooing of almesd*entity*edes, and so at length departed out of this world. Thus our writers differ from the Scotish historie, both in name and maner of end as concerning the daughter of king Edward that was coupled in mariage with Sithrike.</p>

In consideration of which d*entity*ed of pietie and dutie of mindfull consanguimitie, the king of England both hartilie thanked earle Adolfe, and bestowed great gifts vpon the church where his brother was thus buried. For verelie 

<note place="marg">Repentance too late.</note>

 king Adelstane after his displeasure was asswaged, and hearing of this miserable end of his brother, sore repented himselfe of his rigour so extended towards him, in so much that he could neuer abide the man that had giuen the information against him, which was his cupbearer, so that on a time as the said cupbearer serued him at the table, and came towards him with a cup of wine, one of him feet chanced to slide, but he recouered himselfe with the helpe of the other foot, saieng, "One brothey yet hath holpen *entity* succored the other:" which words cost him his life. For the king remembring that by his accusation he had lost his brother that might haue b*entity*ene an aid to him, caused this said cupbearer to be straight put to death.</p>
<p>In this meane while, Aulafe the sonne of Sitherike, late king of Northumberland (who is 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>W </unclear></emph></note>

 also named by writers to be king of the Irishmen, and of manie Nands) assembled a great power of Danes, Irishmen, Scots, and other people of the out Iles, and imbarked them in 615 ships and craiers, with the which he arriued in the mouth of Humber, and there comming on land, began to inuade the countrie. This Aulafe had maried the daughter of Constantine

 king of Scots, by whose procurement, notwithstanding his late submission, Aulafe 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 tooke in hand this iournie. King Adelstane aduertised of his enimies arriuall, gathered his people, and with all conuenient sp*entity*ed hasted towards them, and approching n*entity*erer vnto them, pitcht downe his field at a place called by some Brimesburie, by others Brimesford, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt. Wil. Maim.</emph></note>

 and also Brunaubright, and by the Scotish writers Browmingfield.</p>
<p>When knowledge hereof was had in the enimies campe, Aulafe enterprised a maruelous 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph> Hector. Boel. Run. Higd. Aulafe disguised, comrueth to view the English camp.</note>

 exploit, for taking with him an harpe, he came into the English campe, offring himselfe disguised as a minstrell, to shew some part of his cunning in musicke vpon his instrument: and so being suffered to passe from tent to tent, and admitted also to plaie afore the king, surueied the whole state and order of the armie. This doone, he returned, meaning by a cammisado to set vpon the kings tent. But one that had scrued as a souldier sometime vnder Aulafe, chanced by marking his demeanour to know him, and after he was gone, vttered to the king what he knew. The king s*entity*emed to be displeased, in that he had not told him so much before Aulafs departure: but in excusing himselfe, the souldier said: "Ye must remember (if it like your grace) that the same faith which I haue giuen vnto you, I sometime owght vnto Aulafe, therfore if I should haue betraied him now, you might well stand in doubt least I should hereafter doo the like to you: but if you will follow mine aduise, remoue your tent, least happilie he assaile you vnwares." The king did so, and as it chanced in the night following, Aulafe came to assaile the English campe, and by 

<note place="marg">Aulafe assailcth the English eampe.</note>

 fortune comming to the place where the kings tent stood before, he found a bishop lodged, which with his companie was come the same day to the armie, and had pitcht vp his tent in that place from whence the king was remoned: and so was the same bishop, and most part of his men there slaine, which slaughter executed, Aulafe passed forward, and came to <pb n="688"/>the kings tent, who in this meane time, by reason of the alarum raised, was got vp, and taking to him his sword in that sudden fright, by chance it fell out of the scabbard, so 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph></note>

 that he could not find it, but calling to God and S. Aldelme (as saith Polychron.) his sword was restored to the scabbard againe. The king comforted with that miracle, boldlie preased foorth vpon his enimies, and so valiantlie resisted them, that in the end he put them to flight, and chased them all that morning and day following, so that he slue of them an

<p>He was of such a stature, as exceeded not the common sort of men, stooping somewhat, and yellowe haired, for his valiancie ioined with courtesie beloued of all men, yet sharpe against rebels, and of inuincible constancie: his great deuotion toward the church appeared in the building, adorning *entity* indowing of monasteries and abbeis. He built one at Wilton within the diocesse of Salisburie, and an other at Michelnie in Summersetshire. But besides these foundations, there were few famous monasteries within this land, but that he adorned the same either with some new p*entity*ece of building, iewels, bookes, or portion of lands. He

 had in exc*entity*eding fauour Wolstan archbishop of Yorke that liued in his daies, for whose sake he greatlie inriched that bishoprike. His fame spread ouer all the parties of Europe, so that sundrie princes thought themselues happie if they might haue his friendship, either by affinitie or otherwise: by meanes whereof, he bestowed his sisters so highlie in mariage as before ye haue heard. He receiued manie noble and rich presents from diuers princes, as from Hugh king of France, horsses and sundrie rich iewels, with certeine relikes: as Constantines sword, in the hilt whereof was set one of the nailes wherewith Christ was fastened to the crosse, the speare of Charles the great, which was thought to be the same wherewith the side of our sauiour was pearced, the banner of saint Maurice, with a part of the holie crosse, and likewise a part of the thorned crowne; yet Mandeuile saw the one halfe of this crowne in France, and the other at Constantinople, almost 400 yeares after this time, as he writeth. Of these iewels king Adelstane gaue part to the abbie of saint Swithon at Winchester, and part to the abbie of Malmesburie. Moreouer, the king of Norwaie sent vnto him a goodlie ship of fine woorkmanship, with gilt sterne and purple sailes, furnished round about the decke within with a rowe of gilt pauises. *entity* In the daies

 the third king of Scotland. The Danes of Northumberland rebelled against this Edmund, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 and ordeined Aulafe to be their king, whom they had call out of Ireland. Some write that this Aulafe, which now in the beginning of Edmunds reigne came into Northumberland, was king of Norwaie, *entity* hauing a great power of men with him, marched foorth towards the south parts of this land, in purpose to subdue the whole: but king Edmund raised a mightie armie, and incountred with his enimies at Leicester. Howbeit, yer the matter came to the vttermost triall of battell, through the earnest sute of the archbishop of Canturburie and Yorke Odo and Wolstan, a peace was concluded; so as Edmund should inioy all that part 

<note place="marg">A peace concluded.</note>

 of the land which lieth from Watlingstr*entity*et southward, *entity* Aulafe should inioy the other part as it lieth from the same street northward. Then Aulafe tooke to wife the ladie Alditha,

 hand. But this Aulafe in the yeare following, after he had destroied the church of saint Balter, and burned Tinningham, departed this life. Then the other Aulafe that was sonne to king Sithrike, tooke vpon him to gouerne the Northumbers.</p>
<p>After this, in the yeare 942, king Edmund assembling an armie, first subdued those 

<note place="marg"><date>942.</date></note>

 Danes which had got into their possession the cities and towns of Lincolne, Leicester, Darbie, Stafford, and Notingham, constreining them to receiue the christian faith, and reduced all the countries euen vnto Humber vnder his subiection. This doone, Aulafe and Reinold the sonne of Gurmo, who (as you haue heard) subdued Yorke, as a meane the

 sooner to obteine peace, offered to become christians, *entity* to submit themselues vnto him: wherevpon he receiued them to his peace. There be that write, that this Aulafe is not that Aulafe which was sonne to king Sithrike, but rather that the other was he with whom king Edmund made partition of the realme: but they agree, that this second Aulafe was a Dane also, *entity* being conuerted to the faith as well through constraint of the kings puissance, as through the preaching of the gospell, was baptised, king Edmund being godfather both vnto him, and vnto the foresaid Reinold, to Aulafe at the verie fontstone, and to Reinold at his confirmation at the bishops hands. Neuerthelesse, their wicked natures could not rest

<note place="marg">Leolin king of Southwales aided king Edmund in this enterprise.</note>

<p>Moreouer, he wasted and spoiled whole Cumberland, because he could not reduce the people of that countrie vnto due obeisance, and conformable subiection. The two sonnes of Dunmaile king of that prouince he apprehended, and caused their eies to be put out. Herewith vpon consideration either of such aid as he had receiued of the Scots at that time, 

<note place="marg"><date>946.</date></note>

 or some other friendlie respect, he assigned the said countrie of Cumberland vnto Malcolme king of Scots, to hold the same by fealtie of him and his successors. The Scotish chronicles, peruerting the time and order or the acts and doings of the English kings which reigned about this season, affirme, that by couenants of peace concluded betwixt Malcolme king of Scotland, and Adelstan king of England, it was agr*entity*ed, that Cumberland should remaine to the Scots: as in their chronicles you may find at full expressed. And againe, that Indulfe, who succ*entity*eded Malcolme in the kingdome of Scotland, aided king Edmund against Aulafe, whom the same chronicles name Aualassus, but the time which they attribute vnto the reignes of their kings, will not alow the same to stand. For by account of their writers, king Malcolme began not his reigne till after the deceasse of king Adelstan, who departed this life in the yeare 940. And Malcolme succ*entity*eded Constantine the third in the yeare 944, which was about the third yeare of king Edmunds reigne, and after Malcolme (that reigned 15 yeares) succeeded Indulfe in the yeare 959. The like discordance precedeth and followeth in their writers, as to the diligent reader, in conferring their chronicles with ours, manifestlie appeareth.

<p>Other say, that k*entity*eping a great feast at the aforesaid place on the day of saint Augustine the English apostle (which is the 26 of Maie, and as that yeare came about, it fell on the tuesday) as he was set at the table, he espied where a common robber was placed neere vnto 

<note place="marg"><date>946.</date></note>

 him, whome sometime he had banished the land, and now being returned without licence, he presumed to come into the kings presence, wherewith the king was so moued with high disdaine, that he suddenl*entity*e arose from the table, and flew vpon the theefe, and catching him by the heare of the head, threw him vnder his f*entity*et, wherewith th*entity*efe, hauing fast hold on the king, brought him downe vpon him also, and with his knife stroke him into the bellie, in such wise, that the kings bowels fell out of his chest, and there presentlie died. The theefe was bewen in p*entity*eces by the kings seruants, but yet he slue and hurt diuers before they could dispatch him. This, chance was lamentable, namelie to the English people, which by the ouertimelie death of their king, in whome appeared manie euident tokens of great excellencie, lost the hope which they, had conceiued of great wealth to increase by his prudent and most princelie gouernement. His bodie was buried at Glastenburie where Dunstane was then abbat.</p>
<p>There be that write, that the death of king Edmund was signified aforeband to Dunstane, 

<note place="marg"><emph><unclear>Capgr .</unclear></emph></note>

 who about the same time attending vpon the same king, as he remooued from one place to 

<note place="marg">A vaipe tale.</note>

 an other, chanced to accompanie himselfe with a noble man, one duke Elstane, and as they rode togither, behold suddenlie Dunstane saw in the waie before him, where the kings <pb n="691"/>musicians rode, the diuell running and leaping amongst the same musicians after a reioising maner, whome after he had beheld a good while, he said to the duke; Is it possible that you may see that which I s*entity*? The duke answered that he saw nothing otherwise than he ought to s*entity*e. Then said Dunstane, Blesse your eies with the signe of the crosse, and trie

 whether you can see that I s*entity*e. And when he had doone as Dunstane appointed him, he saw also the f*entity*end in likenesse of a little short euill fauoured Aethiopian dansing and leaping, whereby they gathered that some euill hap was towards some of the companie: but when they had crossed and blessed them, the fould spirit vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p>Now after they had talked of this vision, and made an end of their talke touching the 

<note place="marg">Dunstane an interpretor of dresmes.</note>

 same, the duke required of Dunstane to interpret a dreame which he had of late in sleepe, and that was this: He thought that he saw in a vision the king with all his nobles sit in his dining chamber at meate, and as they were there making merrie togither, the king chanced to fall into a dead sl*entity*epe, and all the noble men, and those of his councell that were about him were changed into robucks and goats. Dunstane quicklie declared that this dreame signified the kings death, and the changing of the nobles into dum and insensible

 beasts betokened that the princes *entity* gouernors of the realme should decline from the waie of truth, and wander as foolish beasts without a guide to rule them. Also the night after this talke when the king was set as supper, Dunstane saw the same spirit, or some other, walke vp and downe amongst them that waited at the table, and within thr*entity*e daies after, the king was slaine, as before ye haue heard.</p>

But bicause that Wolstane the archbishop of Yorke was of counsell with his countriemen in reuolting from king Edred, and aduancing of Hericius, king Edred tooke him and kept him in prison a long time after, but at length in respect of the reuerence which he bare to his calling, he set him at libertie, and pardoned him his offense.

He was consecrated at Kingston vpon Thames by Odo the archbishop of Canturburie. On the verie day of his coronation, as the lords were set in councell about weightie matters touching the gouernment of the realme, he rose from the place, gat him into a

Dunstane latelie before named abbat of Glastenburie, did not onlie without feare of displeasure reprooue the K. for such shamefull abusing of his bodie, but also caused the archbishop of Canturburie to constreine him to forsake that woman whom vnlawfulie he kept.</p>
<p>There be that write, that there were two women both mother and dauaghter, whome king 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Capgraus.</emph></note>

 Edward kept as concubines: for the mother being of noble parentage, sought to satisfie the kings lust, in hope that either he would take hir or hir daughter vnto wife. And therefore perceiuing that Dunstane was sore against such wanton pastime as the king vsed in their companie, she so wrought, that Dunstane was through hir earnest trauell banished the land, 

<note place="marg">Dunstane banished the realme.</note>

 This is also reported, that when he should depart the realme, the diuell was heard in the west end of the church, taking vp a great laughter after his roring maner, as though he should shew himselfe glad and ioifull at Dunstanes going into exile. But Dunstane perceiuing his

<p>The fame of this noble prince was spred ouer all, as well on this side the sea as beyond, insomuch that great resort of strangers chanced in his daies, which came euer into this land to serue him, and to s*entity*e the state of his court, as Saxons and other, yea and also Danes,

<p>IN this meane time, Alfred the wife of king Edgar (as some say) or rather. (as others write) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Osborns</emph> and <emph>Cnpgtuts</emph> bold that she was not his wife but a nus. <emph>Wil. Malm.</emph> Horger.</note>

 his concubine died, of whome he had begot a sonne named Edward. The death of this woman caused the king to commit an heinous offense. For albeit at the same time the fame went, that Horgerius duke of Cornewall, or rather Deuonshire, had a daughter named Alfred, a damosell of excellent beautie, whome Edgar minding to haue in mariage, appointed one of his noble men called earle Ethelwold, to go with all speed into Cornewall or Deuonshire, to s*entity*e if the yoong ladies beautie answered the report that went of hir, and so to breake the matter to hir father in his behalfe: yet Ethelwold being a yong iollie gentleman, tooke his iournie into Cornewall, and comming to the duke, was well receiued, and had a sight of his daughter, with whose beautie he was streight rauished so far in loue, that not regarding the 

<note place="marg">Erle Pthelwold deceiueth the king of his wife.</note>

 kings plcasure, who had sent him thither, he began to purchase the good will of both father and daughter for himselfe, and did so much that he obteined the same in d*entity*ed Herevpon returning to the king, he informed him that the damosell was not of such beautie and comelie personage, as might be thought woorthie to match in mariage with his maiestie.</p>

<pb n="696"/>
<p>Shortlie after perceiuing the kings mind by his wrongfull misreport to be turned, and nothing bent that way, he began to sue to him that he might with his fauour marie the same damosell: which the king granted, as one that cared not for hir, bicause of the credit which he gaue to Ethelwolds words. And so by this meanes Ethelwold obteined Alfred in mariage, which was to his owne destruction, as the case fell out. For when the fame of hir passing beautie did spread ouer all the realme, now that she was maried and came more abroad in sight of the people, the king chanced to heare thereof and desirous to s*entity*e hir, deuised vnder colour of hunting to come vnto the house of Ethelwold, and so did: where he had no sooner set his eie vpon hir, but he was so farre wrapped in the chaine of burning 

<note place="marg">King Edgar s*entity*eketh the destruction of earle Ethelwold.</note>

 concupiscence, that to obteine his purpose, he shortlie after contriued Ethelwolds death, and maried his wife.</p>
<p>Some say, that the woman kindled the brand of purpose: for when it was knowne, that the king would s*entity*e hir, Ethelwold willed hir in no wise to trim vp hir selfe, but rather to disfigure hir in fowle garments, and some euil fauored attire, that hir natiue beautie should not appeare: but she perceiuing how the matter went, of spite set out hir selfe to the vttermost, so that the king vpon the first sight of hir, became so farre inamored of hir beautie, 

<note place="marg">King Edgar a murtherer.</note>

 that taking hir husband foorth with him on hunting into a forrest or wood then called Warlewood, *entity* after Horewood, not shewing that he meant him anie hurt, till at length he had got him within the thicke of the wood, where he suddenlie stroke him through with his dart. Now as his bastard son came to the place, the king asked him how he liked the maner of hunting, wherto he answered; "Verie well if it like your grace, for that that liketh you, ought not to displease me." With which answer the king was so pacified, that he indeuored by pretending his fauor towards the sonne, to extenuat the tyrannicall murther of the father. Then did the king marie the countesse Alfred, and of hir begat two sonnes, Edmund which died yoong, and Etheldred or Egelred.</p>
<p>Besides this cruell act wrought by king Edgar, for the satisfieng of his fleshlie lust, he also plaied another part greatlie to the staine of his honor, mooued also by wanton loue, with a yoong damosell named Wilfrid, for after that she had (to auoid the danger of him) either professed hir selfe a nun, or else for colour (as the most part of writers agr*entity*e) got hirselte into a nunrie, and clad hir in a nuns w*entity*ed, he tooke hir foorth of hir cloister, and lay by hir sundris times, and begat on hir a daughter named Edith, who comming to conuenient age, was made 

<note place="marg">His licentious life *entity* incontinencie.</note>

 a nun. A third example of his incontinencie is written by authors, and that is this. It chanced on a time that he lodged one night at Andeuer, and hauing a mind to a lords daughter there, he commanded that she should bee brought to his bed. But the mother of the gentlewoman would not that hir daughter should be defloured: and therefore in the darke of the night brought one of hir maidseruants, and laid hir in the kings bed, she being both faire, proper, and pleasant.</p>
<p>In the morning when the day began to appeare, she made hast to arise: and being asked of the king why she so hasted; That I may go to my daies worke if it please your grace (quoth she.) Herewith she being staied by the king, as it were against hir will, she fell downe on hir kn*entity*es, and required of him that she might be made fr*entity*e, in guerdon of hir nights worke. For (saith she) it is not for your honor, that the woman which hath tasted the pleasure of the kings bodie should anie more suffer seruitude vnder the rule and appointment of a sharpe and rough mistresse.</p>
<p>The king then being mooued in his spirits, laughed at the matter, though not from the heart, as he that tooke great indignation at the dooings of the dutchesse, and pitied the case of the poore wench. But yet in fine (turning earnest to a iest) he pardoned all the parties, and aduanced the wench to high honor, farre aboue those that had rule of hir afore, so that she ruled them (willed they nilled they:) for he vsed hir as his paramour, till he maried the foresaid Alfred.</p>
<p>For these youthfull parts, *entity* namelie for the rauishing to Wilfride (which though she were no nun, yet the offense seemed heinous, for that he should not once touch anie woman shadowed <pb n="697"/>vnder that habit) he greatlie displeased Dunstane, so that by him he was put to his 

<note place="marg">Note the d*entity*ep hypoceisie of Eunstane.</note>

 seuen y*entity*eres penance, and kept from the crowne till the 12 yeere of his reigne or more. For some write that he was not crowned nor annointed king, till the 30 y*entity*ere of his age, which 

<note place="marg"><emph>Rau. Higd, Falias out of Guido de Columna. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 should be about the 13 or 14 yeere of his reigne by that account, sith he entred into the rule of the kingdome about the 16 yeere of his age. In d*entity*ed one author witnessech, that he was consecrated at Bath on a Whitsunday, the 13 y*entity*ere of his reigne, and that by Dunstane archbishop 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hupt. Runul. His.</emph></note>

 of Canturburie, and Oswold archbishop of Yorke. But some which suppose that he was consecrated king immediatlie vpon the death of Edridus, affirme that he was crowned and annointed king by the archbishop Odo, Dunstane as then remaining in exile, from whence he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polyder.</emph></note>

 was immediatlie reuoked by Edgar, and first made bishop of Worcester (as hath beene said) and after the decease of Odo was aduanced to be archbishop of Canturburie, But by some writers 

<note place="marg"><emph>Mall. W*entity*n. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 it appeareth, that Dunstane was reuoked out of exile immediatlie vpon partition of the realme betwixt Edwin and Edgar, which chanced in the y*entity*ere 957, by the rebellion of the people of Mercia, *entity* others (as before ye haue heard:) and that in the y*entity*ere following the archbishop Odo died, after whome succ*entity*eded Alfin bishop of Winchester, who also died the same y*entity*ere that king Edward deceassed, as he went to fetch his pall from Rome, and then Brighthelme bishop of Dorchester was elected archbishop. But bicause he was not able to discharge so great an office, by K. Edgars commandement he was forced to giue place to Dunstane.</p>
<p>Toward the latter end of king Edgars daies, the Welshmen mooued some rebellion against 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabion. Ran. Higd.</emph> The Welshmen rebel and are chastised.</note>

 him. Wherevpon he assembled an armie, and entering the countrie of Glamorgan, did much hurt in the same, chastising the inhabitants verie sharpelie for their rebellious attempts. Amongst other spoiles taken in those parties at that time by the men of war, the bell of saint Ellutus was taken away, and hanged about a horsses necke, and (as hath b*entity*ene reported) in the after noone, it chanced that king Edgar laid him downe to rest, wherevpon in sleepe there appeared one vnto him, and smote him on the breast with a speare. By reason of which vision he caused all things that had beene taken away to be restored againe. But within nine daies 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hiu Malmts.</emph> King Edgar departeth this life.</note>

 after the king died. Whether anie such thing chanced, or that he had anie such vision it forceth not. But truth it is, that in the 37 yeere of his age, after he had reigned 16 y*entity*eres and two moneths he departed this life, the 8 day of Iulie, and was buried at Glastenburie.</p>
<p>This Edgar is highlie renowmed of writers for such princelie qualities as appeared in him, 

<note place="marg">Wherefore Edgas is praised of some writers.</note>

 but chieflie for that he was so beneficiall to the church, namelie to moonks, the aduancement of whome he greatlie sought, both in building abbeies new from the ground, in reparing those that were decaied: also by inriching them with great reuenues, and in eonuerting collegiat churches into monasteries, remoouing secular priests, and bringing in moonks in their places. There passed no one y*entity*ere of his reigne, wherin he founded no: one abbeie or other. The abbeie of Glastenburie which his father had begun he finished. The abbeie of Abington also he accomplished and set in good order. The abbeies of Peterborough *entity* Thornie he established. The nunrie of Wilton he founded and richlie endowed, where his daughter Editha was professed, and at length became abbesse there. To be briefe, he builded (as the chronicles record) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian. Ran. Higd. Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 to the number of 40 abbeies and monasteries, in some of which he placed moonks, and in some nuns. By his example in those daies, other nobles, as also prelates, *entity* some of the laitie, did begin the foundation of sundrie abbeies and monasteries: as Adelwold bishop of Winchester builded the abbeie of Elie, and (as some say) Peterborough *entity* Thornie, though they 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 were established by the king (as before is mentioned.) Also earle Ailewin, at the exhortation 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 of the same bishop Adelwold, builded the abbere of Ramsey, though some attribute the dooing thereof vnto Oswald the archbishop of Yorke, and some to king Edward the elder.</p>
<p>To conclude, the religious orders of moonks and nuns in these daies florished, and the state 

<note place="marg"><emph>Mall. Hest.</emph> Moonks esteemed *entity* secular priests little regarded.</note>

 of secular priests was smallie regarded, insomuch that they were constreined to auoid out of diuerse colleges, and to leaue the same vnto moonks, as at Worcester and Winchester, where in the new monasterie, bicause the kings liued not in such sorr as was then thought requisite, the <pb n="698"/>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd. lib.</emph> 6. <emph>cap.</emph> 9.</note>

 prebends were taken from them and giuen to vicars. But when the vicars were thought to vse themselues no better, but rather worse than the other bef*entity*re them, they were likewise put out, and moonks placed in their roomes by authoritie of pope Iohn the 13. This reformation, or rather deformation was vsed by king Edgar in many other places of the realme.</p>
<p>He was (as appeareth by diuers writers) namelie in his beginning, cruell against his owne 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Ran. Higd. Tho. Eliot.</emph></note>

 people, and wanton in lusting after yoong women (as you haue heard before.) Of stature *entity* proportion of bodie he was but small and low, but yet nature had inclosed within so little a personage such strength, that he durst incounter and combat with him that was thought most 

<note place="marg">Edgar small of stature but strong and hardie.</note>

 strong, onelie doubting this, least he which should haue to doo with him should stand in feare of him. And as it chanced at a great feast (where oftentimes men vse their toongs more liberallie than n*entity*edeth) Kenneth the king of Scots cast out certeine words in this maner: "It 

<note place="marg">Kenneth king of Scots.</note>

 may (saith h*entity*e) s*entity*eme a maruell that so manie countries and prouinces should be subiect to such a little sillie bodie as Edgar is." These words being borne awaie by a iester or minstrell, and afterwards vttered to Edgar with great reproch, he wiselie dissembled the matter for a time, although he kept the remembrance thereof inclosed within his breast: and vpon occasion; at length feigned to go on hunting, taking the king of Scots forth with him: and hauing caused one of his seruants to conuey two swords into a place within the forrest by him appointed in secret wise, of purpose he withdrew from the residue of his companie, and there accompanied onelie with the Scotish king, came to the place where the swords were laid; and 

<note place="marg">The noble courage of king Edgar.</note>

 there taking the one of them, deliuered the other to the Scotish king, willing him now to assaie his strength, that they might shew by proofe whether of them ought to be subiect to the other; "Start not, but trie it with me (saith he:) for it is a shame for a king to be full of brags at bankets, and not to be readie to fight when triall should be made abroad." The Scotish king herewith being astonied and maruellouslie abashed, fell downe at his feet, and with much humilitie confessed his fault, *entity* desired pardon for the same, which vpon such his 

<note place="marg"><emph>[* Sic.]</emph></note>

 humble submission king Edward easilie granted.</p>
<p>This noble prince had two wiues, Egelfrida or Elfrida, surnamed the white, the daughter of a mightie duke named Ordiner, by whome he had issue a sonne named Edward that succ*entity*eded him. His second wife was called Alfreda the daughter of Orgar duke of Deuon or Cornewall (as some saie) by whome he had issue Edmund that died before his father, and Egelred which afterwards was king. Also he had issue a base, daughter named Editha, begotten 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 of his concubine Wilfrid (as before ye haue heard.) The state of the realme in king Edgars daies was in good point, for both the earth gaue hir increase verie plentiouslie, the clements shewed themselues verie fauorable, according to the course of times: peace was mainteined, and no inuasion by forraine enimies attempted. For Edgar had not onelie all the whole Ile of Britaine in subiection, but also was ruler *entity* souereigne lord ouer all the kings of the out Iles that lie within the seas about all the coasts of the same Britaine euen vnto the 

<note place="marg"><unclear></unclear> subiect to king Edgar.</note>

 realme of Norwaie. He brought also a great part of Ireland vnder his subiection, with the cirie of Dublin, as by authentike recordes it dooth and may appeare.</p>

 that Edward was more fit for their behoofe to continue the world in the former course as Edgar had left it, than his brother Egelred (whose mother and such as tooke part with hir vnder hir sonnes authoritie were likelie inough to turne all vpside downe) vsed the matter so, that with helpe of Oswald the archbishop of Yorke and other bishops, abbats, and certeine of the nobilitie, as the earle of Essex and such like, he preuailed in his purpose, so that (as before is said) the said Edward, being the second or that name which gouerned this land before the conquest, was admitted king, and began his reigne ouer England in the yeare of our Lord 975, in the third yeare of the enmperour Otho the second, in the 20 yeare of the reigne of <unclear>L ar</unclear> king of France, and about the fourth yeare of Cumelerne king of Scotland.

 Edgar and bishop Adelwold had builded within the limits of Mercia. The priests or canons, which had beene expelled in Edgars time out of the prebends and benefices, began to complaine of the wrongs that were doone to them, in that they had beene put out of possession from their liuings, alleging it to be a great, offense and miserable case, that a stranger should come and remoue an old inhabitant, for such maner of dooing could not please God, not yet be allowed of anie good man, which ought of reason to doubt least the same should hap to him which he might s*entity*e to haue b*entity*ene an other mans vndooing About this mattrer was hard hold, for manie of the temporall lords, and namelie the same Alfer, iudged that the priests 

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn. Copg. Hil Malm. Run, Higd. Mall. West. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 had wrong. I so much that they remoued the moonks out of their places, and brought into the monasteries secular priests with their wiues. But Edelwin duke of the Eastangles, *entity* Alfred his brother, with Brightnoth or Brightnode earle of Essex, withstood this dooing, *entity* <pb n="700"/>gathering an armie, with great valiancie mainteined the moonks in their houses, within the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 countrie of Eastangles. Herevpon were councels holden, as at Winchester, at Kirthling in Eastangle, and at Calne.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

<p>At Winchester, when the matter was brought to that passe that the priests were like to haue had theirpurpose, an image of the rood that stood there in the refectorie where they sat in councell, 

<note place="marg">A pretic shift of the moonks to disappoint the priests. <emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 vttered certeine woords in this wise; God forbid it should be so, God forbid it should be so: ye iudged well once, but ye may not change well againe. As though (saith Polydor Virgil) the moonks had more right, which had bereft other men of their possessions, than the priests which required restitution of their owne. But (saith he) bicause the image of Christ hanging on the crosse was thought to speake these words, such credit was giuen thereto, as it had b*entity*ene an oracle, that the priests had their sute dashed, and all the trouble was ceassed. So the moonks held those possessions, howsoeuer they came to them, by the helpe of God, or rather (as saith the same Polydor) by the helpe of man. For there were euen then diuers that thoight this to be rather an oracle of Phebus than of God, that is to say, not published by Gods power, but by the fraud and craftie deceit of men.</p>
<p>The matter therefore was not so quieted, but that vpon new trouble an other councell was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 had at a manour house belonging to the king, called Calne, where they that were appointed to haue the hearing of the matter, sat in an vpper loft. The king by reason of his yoong y*entity*eres was spared, so that he came not there. H*entity*ere as they were busied in arguing the matter, either part laieng for himselfe what could be said, Dunstane was sore reuiled, and had sundrie reproches laid against him: but suddenlie euen in the verie heat of their communication, the ioists of the loft failed, and downe came all the companie, so that manie were slaine and hurt, 

<note place="marg">Dunstane by woorking miracles had his will, when arguments failed.</note>

 but Dunstane alone standing vpon one of the ioists that fell not, escaped safe and sound. And so this miracle with the other made an end of the controuersie betw*entity*ene the priests and moonks, all the English people following the mind of the archbishop Dunstane, who by meanes thereof had his will.</p>
<p>In this meane while, king Edward ruling himselfe by good counsell of such as were thought discr*entity*et and sage persons, gaue great hope to the world that he would walke in his fathers vertuous steps, as alreadie he well began, and bearing alwaie a reuerence to his nother in law,

Afterward by chance as he was hunting in a foruest n*entity*ere the castell of Corfe, where his mother in law and his brother the said Egelred then soiourned, when all his companie were spred abroad in following the game, so that he was left alone, he tooke the waie streight

Wherefore she required him to alight, which he in no wise would y*entity*eld vnto, but said that he had stolne from his companie, and was onelie come to see hir and his brother, and to drinke with them, and therefore would returne to the forrest againe to s*entity*e some more sport.</p>

But being hurt to the death, he fell from his horsse, so as one of his f*entity*et was fastened in the stirrup, by reason whereof his horsse drew him foorth

 through woods and launds, *entity* the bloud which gushed out of the wound shewed token of his death to such as followed him, and the waie to the place where the horsse had left him. That place was called Corphes gate or Corfes gate. His bodie being found was buried without anie solemne funeralls at Warham. For they which enuied that he should inioy the crowne, enuied also the buriall of his bodie within the church: but the memorie of his fame could not so secretlie be buried with the bodie, as they imagined. For sundrie miracles shewed at the place where his bodie was interred, made the same famous (as diuerse haue reported) for there <pb n="701"/>was sight restored to the blind, health to the sicke, and hearing to the deafe, which are

<p>Queene Alfred also would haue ridden to the place where he laie, mooued with repentance (as hath beene said) but the horsse wherevpon she rode would not come neere the graue, for anie thing that could be doone to him. Neither by changing the said horsse could the matter be holpen: for euen the same thing happened to the other horsses. Heerevpon the woman perceiued hir great offense towards God for murthering the innocent, and did so repent hir afterward for the same, that besides the chastising of hir bodie in fasting, and other kind of penance, she imploied all hir substance and patrimonie on the poore, and in building

 and reparing of churches and monasteries. She founded two houses of nuns (as is said) the one at Warwell, the other at Ambresburie, and finallie professed hirselfe a nun in one of them, that is to say, at Warwell, which house she builded (as some affirme) in remembrance of hir first husband that was slaine there by king Edgar for hir sake (as before is mentioned.)</p>
<p>The bodie of this Edward the second, and surnamed the martyr, after that it had remained thr*entity*e y*entity*eres at Warham where it was first buried, was remooued vnto Shaftesburie, and with great reuerence buried there by the forenamed Alfer or Elfer, duke of Mercia, who also did

<note place="marg">EGELRED.</note>

<p>IN the former booke was discoursed the troubled state of this land by the manifold and mutinous inuasions of the Danes; who though they sought to ingrosse the rule of euerie part and parcell therof into their hands yet being resisted by the valiantnesse of the gouernors supported with the aid of their people, they were disappomted of their expectation, and receiued manie a dishonorable or rather reprochfull repulse at their aduersaries hands. Much mischiefe doubtlesse they did, and more had doone, if they had not beene met withall in like measure of extremitie as they offred, to the offense and ouerthrow of great multitudes. Their first entrance into this land is controuersed among writers, some saieng that it was in the daies of king Britricus, other some affirming that it was in the time of king Egbert, *entity*c: about which point (sith it is a matter of no great moment) we count it labour lost to vse manie woords: onelie this by the waie is notewoorthie, that the Danes had an vnperfect or rather a lame and limping rule in this land, so long as the gouernors were watchfull, diligent, politike at home, and warlike abroad. But when these kind of kings discontinued, and that the raines of the regiment fell into the hands of a pezzant not a puissant prince, a man euill qualified, dissolute, slacke and licentious, not regarding the dignitie of his owne person, nor fauoring the good estate of the people; the Danes who before were coursed from coast to coast, and pursued from place to place, as more willing to leaue the land, than desirous to tarrie in the same; tooke occasion of stomach and courage to reenter this Ile, *entity* waxing more bold and confident, more desperate and venturous, spared no force, omitted no opportunitie, let slip no aduantage that they might possiblie take, to put in practise and fullie to accomplish their long conceiued purpose.</p>

<pb n="703"/>
<p>Now bicause the Danes in the former kings daies were reencountred (and that renowmedlie) so often as they did encounter, and s*entity*eking the totall regiment, were dispossessed of their partile principalitie, which by warlike violence they obteined; and for that the Saxons were interessed in the land, and these but violent incrochers, vnable to k*entity*epe that which they came to by constreint; we haue thought it conuenient to comprise the troubled estate of that time in the sixt booke; the rather for the necessarie consequence of matters then in motion: and h*entity*ere d*entity*eme it not amisse, at so great and shamefull loosenesse (speciallie in a prince) ministring hart and courage to the enimie, to begin the seuenth booke. Wherin is expressed the chiefest time of their flourishing estate in this land; if in tumults, vprores, battels, and bloudshed, such a kind of estate may possiblie be found. For h*entity*ere the Danes lord it, heere they take vpon them like souereignes, *entity* h*entity*ere (if at anie time they had absolute authoritie) they did what they might in the highest degr*entity*e: as shall be declared in the vnfortunate affaires of vngratious Egelred or Etheldred, the sonne of king Edgar, and of his last wife queene Alfred, who was ordeined king in place of his brother Edward, after the same Edward was dispatched out of the waie, and began his reigne ouer this realme of England, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 979, which was in the seuenth y*entity*ere of the 

<note place="marg"><date>979.</date></note>

 emperor Otho the second, in the 24 of Lothaire K. of France, and about the second or third yeere of Kenneth the third of that name king of Scotland.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

<p>This Egelred or Etheldred was the 30 in number from Cerdicus the first king of the Westsaxons: through his negligent gouernment, the state of the commonwealth fell into such decaie (as writers doo report) that vnder him it may be said, how the kingdome was come to the vttermost point or period of old and f*entity*eble age, which is the next degr*entity*e to the graue. For wheras, whilest the realme was diuided at the first by the Saxons into sundrie dominions, it grew at length (as it were increasing from youthfull yeeres) to one absolute monarchie, which passed vnder the late remembred princes, Egbert, Adelstane, Edgar, and others, so that in their daies it might be said, how it was growne to mans state, but now vnder this Egelred, through famine, pestilence, and warres, the state thereof was so shaken, turned vpside downe, and weakened on ech part, that rightlie might the season be likened vnto the old broken y*entity*eres of mans life, which through f*entity*eblenesse is not able to helpe it selfe. Dunstane archbishop of Canturburie was thought to haue fores*entity*ene this thing, and therfore refused to annoint Egelred king, which by the murther of his brother should atteine to the gouernment: but at length he was compelled vnto it, and so he consecrated him at Kingston vpon Thames, as the maner then was, on the 24 day of Aprill, assisted by Oswald archbishop of Yorke, and ten other bishops.</p>
<p>But (as hath b*entity*ene reported) Dunstane then said that the English people should suffer 

<note place="marg"><emph>Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 condigne punishment generallie, with losse of ancient liberties, which before that time they had inioied. Dunstane also long before prophesied of the slouthfulnesse that should remaine in this Egelred. For at what time he ministred the sacrament of baptisme to him; shortlie after he came into this world, he defiled the font with the ordure of his wombe (as hath beene said:) whervpon Dunstane being troubled in mind, "By the Lord (saith he) and his blessed mother, this child shall prooue to be a slouthfull person." It hath beene written also, that when he was but ten yeeres of age, and heard that his brother Edward was slaine, he so offended his mother with w*entity*eping, bicause she could not still him, that hauing no rod at hand, she tooke tapers or sizes that stood before hir, and beat him so sore with them, that she had almost killed him, whereby he could neuer after abide to haue anie such candels lighted before him.</p>
<p>This Egelred (as writers say) was nothing giuen to warlike enterprises, but was slouthfull, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 a louer of idlenesse, and delighting in riotous lusts, which being knowne to all men, caused him to be euill spoken of amongst his owne people, and nothing feared amongst strangers. Heerevpon the Danes that exercised rouing on the seas, began to conceiue a boldnesse of courage to disquiet and molest the sea-coasts of the realme, in so much that in the second 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph></note>

 y*entity*ere of this Egelreds reigne, they came with seuen ships on the English coasts of Kent, and 

<note place="marg"><date>980.</date></note>

 <pb n="704"/>

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 spoiled the Ile of Tenet, the towne of Southampton, and in the yeere following they destroied 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph></note>

 S. Petroks abbeie in Cornwall, Porthland in Deuonshire, and diuerse other places by the sea side, speciallie in Deuonshire *entity* Cornwall. Also a great part of Cheshire was destroied by pirats of Norway.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>982.</date></note>

<p>The same y*entity*ere by casualtie of fire, a great part of the citie of London was burnt. In the yeere of our Lord 983, Alfer duke of Mercia departed this life, who was coosen to king

 y*entity*eres after was banished the land. About the eight y*entity*ere of his reigne, Egelred maried one Elgina or Ethelgina, daughter of earle Egbert. In the ninth yeere of his reigne, vpon occasion of strife betw*entity*ene him and the bishop of Rochester, he made warre against the same bishop, wasted his lordships, and besieged the citie of Rochester, till Dunstan procured 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 the bishops peace with painent of an hundred pounds in gold. And bicause the K. would not agr*entity*e with the bishop without moneie at the onelie request of Dunstane, the said Dunstane did send him woord, that sithens he made more account of gold than of God, more of monie than of S. Andrew, patrone of the church of Rochester, and more of couetousnesse than of him being the archbishop, the mischiefs which the Lord had threatned would shortlie fall and come to passe, but the same should not chance whilest he was aliue, who died in the y*entity*ere following, on the 25 of Maie, being saturdaie.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Vita Dunstani.</emph></note>

<p>Of this Dunstane manie things are recorded by writers, that he should be of such holinesse and vertue, that God wrought manie miracles by him, both whilest he liued heere on

 earth, and also after his deceasse. He was borne in Westsaxon, his father was named Heorstan, and his mother Cinifride, who in his youth set him to schoole, where he so profited, that he excelled all his equals in age. Afterward he fell sicke of an ague, which vexed him so sore that it draue him into a frensie: and therefore his parents appointed him to the cure and charge of a certeine woman, where his disease grew so on him, that he fell in a trance, as though he had b*entity*ene dead, and after that he suddenlie arose, *entity* by chance caught a staffe in his hand, and ran vp and downe through hils and dales, and laid about him as though he had b*entity*ene afraid of mad dogs. The next night (as it is said) he gat him to the top of the church (by the helpe of certeine ladders that stood there for woorkemen to mend the roofe) and there ran vp and downe verie dangerouslie but in the end came safelie downe, and laid him to sl*entity*epe betw*entity*ene two men that watched the church that night, *entity* when he awaked, he maruelled how he came there. Finallie, recouering his disease, his parents made him a priest, and placed him in the abbeie of Glastenburie, where he gaue himselfe to the reading of scriptures and knowledge of vertue. But as well his kinsmen as certeine other did raise a report of him, that he gaue not himselfe so much to the reading of scriptures, as to charming, coniuring and sorcerie, which he vtterlie denied: howbeit learned he was in d*entity*ed, *entity* could doo manie pretie things both in handie woorke and other deuises: he had good skill in musicke and delighted much therein. At length he grew in such fauour, that he was aduanced into the seruice of king Adelstane.</p>
<p>Vpon a time, as he came to a gentlewomans house with his harpe, and hoong the same on the wall, while he shaped a priests stole, the harpe suddenlie began to plaie a psalme, which draue the whole houshold in such feare, that they ran out and said, he was too cunning, and knew more than was expedient: wherevpon he was accused of necromancie, and so banished out of the court. After this he began to haue a liking to women, and when Elfeagus then bishop, of Winchester and his coosen, persuaded him to become a moonke, he refused it, for he rather wished to haue maried a yoong damosell, whose pleasant companie he dailie inioied. But being soone after striken with such a swelling disease in his bellie, that all his bodie was brought into such state, as though he had b*entity*ene infected with a foule leprosie, he bethought him selfe, and vpon his recouerie sent to the bishop, who immediatlie shore him a moonke, in which life he liued in so great opinion of holinesse, as he in time became abbat of Glastenburie: where on a time as he was in his praiers before the altar of S. George, he fell asl*entity*epe: and imagining in his dreame, that an vglie rough beare <pb n="705"/>came towards him with open mouth, and set his forefeet vpon his shoulders readie to deuoure him, he suddenlie wakening for feare, caught his walking staffe which he commonlie went with, and laid about him, that all the church rang thereof, to the great woonder of such as stood by. The common tale of his plucking the diuell by the nose with a paire of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polychron.</emph></note>

 pinsors, for tempting him with women, while he was making a chalice: the great loue that the ladie Elfleda n*entity*ere kinswoman to king Adelstane bare him to hir dieng day, with a great manie of other such like matters, I leaue as friuolous, and wholie impertinent to our purpose: onelie this I read, that through declaring of his dreames and visions, he obteined in the time of king Edgar, first the bishoprike of Worcester, after of London, *entity* last of all the archbishoprike of Canturburie. But leauing Dunstane and the fond devises depending vpon the commemoration of his life, we will now returne to the dooings of Egelred, and speake of such things in the next chapter as chanced in his time.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 most cruell inuasions for a time. But shortlie after they had refreshed themselues, and recouered 

<note place="marg"><date>992.</date></note>

 new strength, they began to play their old parts againe, dooing the like misch*entity*efe by their semblable inuasions, as they had vsed before. By reason hereof such feare came vpon the English people, that they despaired to be able to resist the enimies.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph> A nauie set forth.</note>

<p>The king yet caused a nauie to be set foorth at London, whereof he appointed earle Alfrike (whome before he had banished) to be nigh admerall, ioining with him earle Turold. This nauie did set forward from London toward the enimies, who hauing warning giuen them from Alfrike, escaped away without hurt. Shortly after a greater nauie of the Danes came, and incountered with the kings fl*entity*et, so that a great number of the Londoners were 

<note place="marg">Alfrike a traitour to his countrie. <emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 slaine, and all the kings ships taken: for Alfrike like a traitor turned to the Danes side. *entity* Matt. West. maketh other report of this matter, declaring that Alfrike in d*entity*ed being one of the chiefe capteins of the fl*entity*et, aduertised them by forewarning of the danger that toward them, and that when they should come to ioining, the same Alfrike like a traitor fled to the Danes, and after vpon necessitie being put to flight escaped away with them: but the other capteins of the kings fl*entity*et, as Theodred, Elstan, and Escwen, pursued the Danes, tooke one of their ships, and slue all those that were found therein. The Londoners also (as the same Matt. West. saith) met with the nauie of the Danish rouers as they fled away, and slue a great number, and also tooke the ship of the traitor Alfrike with his souldiers *entity* armor, but he himselfe escaped, though with much paine, hauing plaied the like traitorous

<note place="marg"><date>993.</date></note>

<p>About the same time was Bambrough destroied by the Danes, which arriued after in Humber, and wasted the countrie of Lindsey and Yorkeshire, on either side that riuer. And when the Englishmen were assembled to giue them battell, before they ioined, the capteines 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun. Polydor. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 of the English armie, Frena, Godwin, and Fredegist, that were Danes by their fathers side, began to flie away, and escaped, so giuing the occasion of the ouerthrow that lighted on their people. But by some writers it should app*entity*ere, that after the Danes had destroied all the north parts, as they spred abroad without order and good arraie, the people of the 

<note place="marg">Aulafe king of Norway, *entity* Swein king of Denmarke were capteins of this fleet, as saith <emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 countrie fell vpon them, and slue some of them, and chased the residue. Other of the Danes with a nauie of 94 ships entered the Thames, and besieged London about our ladie daie in September. They gaue a verie sore assault to the ctie, and assaied to set it on fire: but the citizens so valiantlie defended themselues, that the Danes were beaten backe and repelled, greatlie to their losse, so that they were constreined to depart thence with dishonor. 

<note place="marg"><date>994.</date></note>

 Then they fell to and wasted the countries of Essex, Kent, Sussex, and Hamshire, and ceassed not till they had inforced the king to compound with them for 16 thousand 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt. Wil. Malm.</emph>The king compoundeth with the Danes for monie. <emph>Matt. West. Simon Dun.</emph> Aulafe king of Norwey baptised. His promise.</note>

 pounds, which he was glad to pay to haue peace with them.</p>
<p>Moreouer, whereas they wintered that y*entity*ere at Southampton, the king procured Aulafe king of the Norwegians to come vnto Andeuer (where at that time he lay) vpon pledges receiued of the king for his safe returne. Elphegus bishop of Winchester, and duke Ethelwold were appointed by king Egelred to bring Aulafe vnto him in most honorable maner. The same time was Aulafe baptised, king Egelred receiuing him at the fontstone, and so he promised neuer after to make anie war within this land. And receiuing great gifts of the king, he returned into his countrie, and kept his promise faithfullie: but the euils tooke not so an end, for other of the Danes sprang vp, as they had. b*entity*ene the heads of the serpent Hydra, some of them euer being readie to trouble the quiet state of the English nation.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Iohn Leland. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

<p>About this season, that is to say, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 995, bishop Aldaine which was 

<note place="marg"><date>995.</date></note>

 fled from Chester in the str*entity*et (otherwise called Cunecester) with the bodie of saint Cuthbert for feare of the inuasion of Danes, vnto Rippon, brought the same bodie now vnto Durham,

 comming into the Seuerne set, they robbed *entity* tooke preies in the coasts of Deuonshire *entity* 

<note place="marg">The Danes inunde the west parts of this land.</note>

 Southwales, and landing at Wicheport, they burned vp the countrie, and cane about vnto Penwitlstr*entity*et on the south coast, and so arriuing in the mouth of f Tamer water, came vnto Lidford, and there wasted all afore them with force of fire. They burned, amongst other places, the monasterie of saint Ordulfe at Essingstocke After this they came into Dorcetshire, 

<note place="marg">Tauestocke.</note>

 and passed through the countrie with flame and fire, not finding anie that offered to resist them. Thee same y*entity*ere also they soiourned in the Ile of Wight, and liued vpon spoiles *entity* 

<note place="marg"><date>998.</date></note>

 preies which they tooke in Hampshire and Sussex. At length they came into the Thames 

<note place="marg"><date>999.</date></note>

 and so by the riuer of Medwey arriued at Rochester. The Kentishmen assembled togither 

<note place="marg">The Danes arriue in the Thames.</note>

 and fought with the Danes, but they were ouercome, and so left the field to the Danes. After this, the same Danes sailed into Normandie, and king Egelred went into Cumberland, where the Danes inhabited in great numbers, whome he ouercame with sore warre, and wasted 

<note place="marg"><date>1000.</date></note>

 almost all Cumberland, taking great spoiles in the same. About the same time, or shortlie after, the Danes with their nauie, returning out of Normandie, came vnto Exmouth, and there 

<note place="marg"><date>1001.</date></note>

 assaulted the castell, but they were repelled by them that kept it. After this they spread 

<note place="marg">Exmouth.</note>

 abroad ouer all the countrie, exercising their accustomed trade of destroieng all before them with fire and sword. The men of Summersetshire fought with them at Pentho, but the Danes 

<note place="marg">Pentho.</note>

 got the vpper hand.</p>
<p>Thus the state of the realme in those daies was verie miserable, for there wanted worthie chieftains to rule the people, and to chastise them when they did amisse. There was no trust in the noble men, for euerie one impugned others dooing, and yet would not deuise which way to deale with better likelihood. When they assembled in councell, and should haue 

<note place="marg">Disagr*entity*ement with councels lors what fruit, it bringeth.</note>

 occupied their heads in deuising remedies for the mischiefe of the common wealth, they turned their purpose vnto altercation, about such strifes, contentions and quareis as each one had against other, and suffered the generall case to lie still in the dust. And if at anie time there was anie good conclusion agreed vpon, for the withstanding of the enimie, *entity* rel*entity*efe of the common wealth, anon should the enimie be aduertised thereof by such as were of aliance or consanguinitie to them. For (as Caxton, Polychr. and others say) the English bloud was <pb n="708"/>so mixed with that of the Danes and Britains, who were like enimies to the Englishmen, that there was almost few of the nobilitie and commons, which had not on the one side a parent of some of them.</p>
<p>Whereby it came to passe, that neither the secret purposes of the king could be concealed till they might take due effect; neither their assemblies proue quiet without quarelling and taking of parts. Manic also being sent foorth with their powers one way (whilest the king went to make resistance another) did reuolt to his enimies, and turned their swords against him (as you haue heard of Elfrike and his complices, and shall read of manie others) so that it was no maruell that Egelred sped no better, and yet was he as valiant as anie of his predecessors, although the moonks fauour him not in their writings, because he demanded aid of them toward his warres, and was nothing fauorable to their lewd hypocrisie. But what is a king if his subiects be not loiall? What is a realme, if the common wealth be diuided? By peace *entity* concord, of small beginnings great and famous kingdomes haue oft times proc*entity*eded; whereas by discord the greatest kingdoms haue oftner bene brought to ruine. And so it proued here, for whilest priuat quareis are pursued, the generall affaires are vtterlie neglected: and whilest ech nation s*entity*eketh to preferre hir owne aliance, the Iland it selfe is like to become a desert.</p>
<p>But to proc*entity*ed with our monasticall writers: certes they lay all the fault in the king, saieng that he was a man giuen to no good exercise, he delighted in fleshlie lustes and riotous bankettings and still sought waies how to gather of his subiects what might be got, as well by vnlawfull 

<note place="marg">The misgoueruement of the king.</note>

 meanes as otherwise. For he would for feined or for verie small *entity* light causes disherit herit his natiue subiects, and cause them to red*entity*eme their owne possessions for great summes of monie. Besides these oppressions, diuers kinds of sicknesses vexed the people also, as 

<note place="marg">Sicknesse vexing the people.</note>

 the bloodie flix, and hot burning agues which then raged through the land, so that manic died thereof. By such manner of meanes therefore, what through the misgouemance of the 

<note place="marg">Treason in the nobilitie.</note>

 king, the treason and disloialtie of the nobilitie, the lacke of good order and due correction amongst the people, and by such other scourges and mishaps as afflicted the English nation in that season, the land was brought into great ruine, so that, where by strength the enimie could not be kept off, there was now no helpe but to appease them with monie. By reason 

<note place="marg">The inhancing of the tribute paid to the Danes.</note>

 hereof from time of the first agr*entity*ement with the Danes for 10 thousand pounds tribute, it was inhanced to 16000 pounds, (as you haue heard) *entity* after that to 20000 pounds, then to 24000 pounds, *entity* so to 30000 pounds, *entity* lastlie to 40000 pounds, till at length the relme 

<note place="marg">The death of qu*entity*ene Elgina.</note>

 was emptied in maner of all that monie and coine that could be found in it. In this meane time died Elgina or Ethelgina the qu*entity*ene. Shortlie after it was deuised that the king should be a 

<note place="marg">Emma.</note>

 suter vnto Richard duke of Normandie, for his sister Emma, a ladie of such excellent beautie, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 that she was named the floure of Normandie. This sute was begun and tooke such good sucesse, 

<note place="marg"><date>1002.</date></note>

 that the king obteined his purpose. And so in the yeare of our Lord 1002, which was 

<note place="marg">Emma daughter of R. duke of Normandie maried to K. Edgar.</note>

 about the 24 yeare of king Egelreds reigne, he maried the said Emma with great solemnitie.</p>
<p>This mariage was thought to be right necessarie, honorable, and profitable for the realme of England, because of the great puissance of the Norman princes in those daies: but as things afterward came to passe, it turned to the subuersion of the whole English state for by such affinitie and dealing as happened hereby betwixt the Normans and Englishmen, occasion in the end was ministred to the same Normans to pretend a title to the crowne of England, in prosecuting of which title, they obteined and made the whole conquest of the land, as after shall appeare. Egelred being greatlie aduanced (as he thought) by reason of his mariage, deuised vpon presumption thereof, to cause all the Danes within the land to be murthered in one day. Herevpon he sent priuie commissioners to all cities, burrowes and townes within his dominions, commanding the rulers and officers in the same, to kill all such Danes as remained within their liberties, at a certeine day prefixed, being saint Brices day, in the yeare 

<note place="marg"><date>1012.</date></note>

 1012, and in the 34 yeare of king Egelreds reigne. Herevpon (as sundrie writers agree) in one 

<note place="marg">The 13 of Nouember. The murder of the Danes.</note>

 day *entity* houre this murther began, and was according to the commission and iniunction executed. But where it first began, the same is vncerteine: some say at Wellowin in Herefordshire, <pb n="709"/>some at a place in Staffordshire called Hownhill, *entity* others in other places, but whersoeuer 

<note place="marg">Hownhill, or Houndhill, a place within Merchington parish beside the forest of N*entity*edwood, some what more than two miles from Vtoxcester. The miserable state of this realme vnder the thraldome of the Danes.</note>

 it began, the dooers repented it after.</p>
<p>But now yer we proc*entity*ed anie further, we will shew what rule the Danes kept here in this realme before they were thus murthered, as in some bookes we find recorded. Whereas it is shewed that the Danes compelled the husbandmen to til the ground *entity* doo all manor of labour and toile to be doone about husbandrie: the Danes liued vpon the fruit and gaines that came thereof, and kept the husbandmens wiues, their daughters, maids and seruants, vsing and abusing them at their pleasures. And when the husbandmen came home, then could they scarse haue such sustenance of meats and drinkes as fell for seruants to haue: so that the Danes had all their commandements, eating and drinking of the best, where the sillie man that was the owner, could hardlie come to his fill of the worst. Besides this, the common people were so oppressed by the Danes, that for feare and dread they called them in euerie such house where anie of them soiourned, Lord Dane. And if an Englishman and a 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet.</emph></note>

 Dane chanced to m*entity*et at anie bridge or streight passage, the Englishman must staie till the Lord Dane were passed. But in processe of time, after the Danes were voided the land, this word Lord Dane was in derision and despight of the Danes turned by Englishmen into a name 

<note place="marg">Lordane whereof the word came.</note>

 of reproch, as Lordane, which till these our daies is not forgotten. For when the people in manie parts of this realme will note and signifie anie great idle lubber that will not labour nor take paine for his liuing, they will call him Lordane. Thus did the Danes vse the Englishmen in most vile manner, and kept them in such seruile thraldome as cannot be sufficientlie vttered.</p>

For that which they could not carie with them, they consumed with fire, burning vp their innes and sleaing their hoasts.

But he was such a craftie dissembler, so greatlie prouided of sleight to dissemble and cloake his falshood, that the king being too much abused by him, had him in singular fauour, whereas he vpon a malicious purpose studied dailie how to bring the realme into vtter destruction, aduertising the enimies from time to time how the state of things stood, whereby they came to knowlege 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 when they should giue place, and when they might safelie come forward. Moreouer, being sent vnto them oftentimes as a commissioner to treat for peace, he persuaded them to warre. But such was the pleasure of God, to haue him and such other of like sort aduanced to honor in this season, when by his diuine prouidence he meant to punish the people of this realme for their wickednesse and sinnes, whereby they had iustlie prouoked his wrath and high displeasure.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>1008.</date></note>

 were appointed to go to sea in the same fleet. There had not b*entity*ene seene the like number 

<note place="marg">Prouision for ships and armour.</note>

 of ships so trimlie rigged and furnished in all points, in anie kings daies before. But no great profitable peece of seruice was wrought by them: for the king had about that time banished a noble yoong man of Sussex called Wilnot, who getting togither twentie sailes, laie vpon the

 coasts taking prices where he could get them. Brithrike the brother of earle Edrike, being desirous to win honor, tooke forth foure score of the said ships, and promised to bring in the enimie dead or aliue.

Swaine, bicause he would not step so farre out of the way as to go to the next bridge, lost a great number of his men as he passed through the 

<note place="marg">Swaine assaulteth London.</note>

 Thames. At his comming to London, he began to assault the citie verie fiercelie, in hope either to put his enimie in such feare that he should despaire of all reliefe and comfort, or at the least trie what he was able to doo. The Londoners on the other part, although they were brought in some feare by this sudden attempt of the enimies, yet considering with themselues, that the hazard of all the whole state of the realme was annexed to theirs, sith their citie was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polyder.</emph></note>

 the chiefe and metropolitane of all the kingdome, they valiantlie stood in defense of themselues, and of their king that was present there with them, beating backe the enimies, chasing them from the walles, and otherwise dooing their best to k*entity*epe them off. At lengthy although the Danes did most valiantlie assault the citie, yet the Englishmen to defend their prince from all iniurie of enimies, did not shrinke, but boldlie sallied foorth at the gates in heapes togither, and incountered with their aduersaries, and began to fight with them verie fiercelie.</p>
<p>Swaine whilest he went about to k*entity*epe his men in order, as one most desirous to reteine the victorie now almost gotten, was compassed so about with the Londoners on each side, that after he had lost a great number of his men, he was constreined for his safegard to breake out through the midst of his enimies weapons, and was glad that he might so escape:

<p><quote><hi rend="smallcap">I SHULD</hi> for euer be put to silence, if there wanted in vs the vertue of a fatherlie mind, in giuing good aduise *entity* counsel for the well ordering and due administration of things in the common wealth, or if there lacked courage or might in our souldiers and men of warre to defend our countrie. Trulie to die in defense of the countrie where we are borne, I confesse it a woorthie thing, and I for my part am readie to take vpon me to enter into the midst of the enimies in defense of my kingdome. But here I see our countrie and the whole English nation to be at a point to fall into vtter ruine. We are ouercome of the Danes, not with weapon or force of armes; but with treason wrought by our owne people: we did at the first prepare a nauie against the enimies, the which that false traitour Elfrike betraid into their hands. Againe, oftentimes haue we giuen battell with euill successe, and onelie through the fault of our owne people that haue beene false and disloiall: whereby we haue bin constreined to agree with the enimies vpon dishonorable conditions, euen as necessitie required, which to ouercome, resteth onelie in God. Such kind of agreement hath beene made in deed to our destruction, sith the enimies haue not sticked to breake it (they being such a wicked kind of people as neither regard God nor man) contrarie to right and reason, and beside all our hope *entity* expectation. So that the matter is come now to this passe, that we haue not cause onlie to feare the losse of our gouernement, but least the name of the whole English nation be destroied for euer. Therefore sithens the enimies are at hand, and as it were ouer our heads, you to whom my commandement hath euer bene had in good regard, prouide, take counsell, and see to succor the state of your countrie now readie to decay and to fall into irrecouerable ruine.</quote></p>

<p>Herevpon they fell in consultation, euerie one alledging and bringing foorth his opinion as seemed to him best: but it appeared they had the woolfe by the eare, for they wist not which way to turne them. If they should giue battell, it was to be doubted least through treason among themselues, the armie should be betraied into the enimies hands, the which would not faile to execute all kind of crueltie in the slaughter of the whole nation. And if they stood not valiantlie to shew themselues readie to defend their countrie, there was no shift but yeeld themselues. Which though it were a thing reprochfull and dishonorable, yet should it be lesse euill, as they tooke the matter, for thereby might manic be preserued from death, and in time to come, be able to recouer the libertie of their countrie, when occasion should be offered. This point was allowed of them all, and so in the end they rested vpon that resolution.</p>
<p>King Egelred therefore determined to commit himselfe into the hands of his brother in

<p>Wherevpon shortlie after, as he was at Gainesbrough or Thetford (as some say) and there in his iollitie talked with his Nobles of his good successe in conquering of this land, he was suddenlie striken with a knife, as it is reported, miraculouslie, for no man wist how or by whome: and within three daies after, to wit, on the third of Februarie he ended his life with grieuous paine and torment in yelling and roring, by reason of his extreame anguish

 beyond all measure. There hath sproong a pleasant tale among the posteritie of that age, how he should be wounded with the same knife which king Edmund in his life time

 vsed to weare. Thus haue some of our writers reported, but the Danish chronicles report a farre more happie end which should chance to this Swaine, than is before mentioned out of our writers: for the said chronicles report, that after he had subdued England, he tooke <pb n="717"/>order with king Egelred, whome they name amisse Adelstane, that he should not ordeine any other successor, but onlie the said Swaine. Then after this, he returned into Denmarke, where vsing himselfe like a right godlie prince, at length he there ended his life, being a verie old man.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all this, when or howsoeuer he died, immediatlie after his deceasse the Danes elected his sonne Cnute or Knought to succeed in his dominions. But the Englishmen

 would maike hast to come ouer to deliuer his countrie out of the hands or strangers. These newes were right ioifull vnto Egelred, who burning in desire to be reuenged on them that had expelled him out of his kingdome, made no longer tariance to set that enterprise forward.

 an assured hope to recouer his kingdom, aided with his brother in laws power, and trusting vpon the assistance of the Englishmen, returned into England in the time of Lent. His returne was ioifull and most acceptable to the English people, as to those that abhorred the rule of the Danes, which was most sharpe and bitter to them, although Cnute did Cnute did

 what he could by bountifulnesse and courteous dealings to haue reteined them vnder his obeisance.</p>
<p>And of an intent to procure Gods fauour in the well ordering of things for the administration in the common wealth, he sought first to appease his wrath, and also to make amends to saint Edmund for his fathers offense committed (as was thought) against him: insomuch that after he had obteined the kingdome, he caused a great ditch to be cast round about the 

<note place="marg">S. Edmund, ditch.</note>

 land of saint Edmund, and granted manie fr*entity*edoms to the inhabitants, acquiting them of certeine taskes and paiments, vnto the which other of their neighbours were contributarie. He also builded a church on the place where saint Edmund was buried, and ordeined an house of moonks there, or rather remooued the canons or secular priests that were there afore, and put moonks in their roomes. He offered vp also his crowne vnto the same

<p>But these things were not done now at the first, but after that he was established in the kingdome. For in the meane time, after that king Egelred was returned out of Normandie, Cnute as then soiourning at Gainesbrough, remained there till the feast of Easter, and made agr*entity*ement with them of Lindsey, so that finding him horsses, they should altogither go foorth to spoile their neighbors. King Egelred aduertised thereof, sped him thither with a mightie host, and with great crueltie burned vp the countrie, and slue the more part of the inhabitants, bicause they had taken part with his enimies. Cnute as then was not of power

<p>When this cruell act according to his commandement was doone, taking the sea, he sailed into Denmarke: but yet tooke not all the Danes with him which his father brought thither. For earle Turkill perceiuing the wealthinesse of the land, compounded with the <pb n="718"/>

 Englishmen, and chose rather to remaine in a region replenished with all riches, than to returne home into his owne countrie that wanted such commodities as were here to be had. And yet (as some thought) he did not forsake his souereigne lord Cnute for anie euill meaning towards him, but rather to aid him (when time serued) to recouer the possession of England againe, as it afterwards well appeared. For notwithstanding that he was now reteined by K. Egelred with fortie ships, and the flower of all the Danes that were men of warre, so that Cnute returned but with 60 ships into his countrie: yet shortlie after, erle Turkill with 9 of those ships sailed into Denmarke, submitted himselfe vnto Cnute, counselled him to returne into England, and promised him the assistance of the residue of those 

<note place="marg"><emph>Enocomium Emm*entity*.</emph></note>

 Danish ships which yet remained in England, being to the number of thirtie, with all the souldiers and mariners that to them belonged. To conclude, he did so much by his earnest persuasions, that Cnute (through aid of his brother Harrold king of Denmarke) got togither a nauie of two hundred ships, so roially decked, furnished, and appointed, both for braue shew and necessarie furniture of all maner of weapons, armor *entity* munition, as it is strange to consider that which is written by them that liued in those daies, and tooke in hand to register the dooings of that time. Howbeit to let this pompe of Cnutes fl*entity*ete passe, which (no doubt) was right roiall, consider a little and looke backe to Turkill, though a sworne seruant to king Egelred, how he did direct all his drift to the aduancement of Cnute, and his owne commoditie, cloking his purposed treacherie with pretended amitie, as shall appeare hereafter by his deadlie hostilitie.</p>

<note place="marg">A councell at Oxford. Sigeferd and Morcad murdered.</note>

 Egelred held a councell at Oxford, at the which a great number of noble men were present, both Danes and Englishmen, and there did the king cause Sigeferd and Morcad two noble personages of the Danes to be murdered within his owne chamber, by the traitorous practise of Edrike de Streona, which accused them of some conspiracie. But the quarell was onelie as men supposed, for that the king had a desire to their goods and possessions.</p>

<p>Their seruants tooke in hand to haue reuenged the death of their maisters, but were beaten backe, wherevpon they fled into the steeple of saint Friswids church, and kept the same, till fire was set vpon the place, and so they were burned to death. The wife of Sigeferd was taken, *entity* sent to Malmsburie, being a woman of high fame and great worthinesse, wherevpon the kings eldest sonne named Edmund, tooke occasion vpon pretense of other businesse to go thither, and there to s*entity*e hir, with whome he fell so far in loue, that he tooke and maried hir.

<p>Whilest these things were a dooing, Cnute hauing made his prouision of ships and men, 

<note place="marg">Cnute returneth into England.</note>

 with all necessarie furniture (as before ye haue heard) for his returne into England, set forward with full purpose, either to recouer the realme out of Egelreds hands, or to die in the quarrell. Herevpon he landed at Sandwich, and first earle Turkill obteined licence to

 go against the Englishmen that were assembled to resist the Danes, and finding them at a place called Scorastan, he gaue them the ouerthrow, got a great bootie, and returned therewith to the ships. After this, Edrike gouernor of Norwaie made a rode likewise into an other part of the countrie, *entity* with a rich spoile, and manie prisoners, returned vnto the nauie. After this iournie atchiued thus by Edrike, Cnute commanded that they should not waste the countrie anie more, but gaue order to prepare all things readie to besiege London: but before he attempted that enterprise, as others write, he marched foorth into Kent, or rather

Herevpon, all the west countrie submitted it selfe vnto Cnute, who receiued pledges of the chiefe lords and nobles, and then set forward to subdue them of Mercia. The people of that countrie would not y*entity*eld, but determined to defend the quarrell and title of king Egelred, so long as they might haue anie capteine that would stand with them, and helpe to order them. In the yeare 1016, in Christmas, Cnute and earle Edrike passed the Thames

Herevpon the armie brake vp, *entity* king Egelred withdrew to London, there to abide his enimies within the walles, with whom in the field he doubted to trie the battell. His sonne Edmund got him to Vtred, an earle of great

<p>But Cnute perceiuing whereabout they went, politikelie deuised to frustrate their purpose, 

<note place="marg">Cnute, what countries he passed through.</note>

 and with dooing of like hurt in all places where he came, passed through Buckinghamshire, Bedfordshire, Huntingtonshire, and so through the fens came to Stamford, and then entred into Lincolnshire, and from thence into Notinghamshire, *entity* so into Yorkeshire, not sparing to doo what mischiefe might be deuised in all places where he came. Vtred aduertised <pb n="720"/>hereof, was constreined to depart home to saue his owne countrie from present destruction, and therefore comming backe into Northumberland, *entity* perceiuing himselfe not able to resist 

<note place="marg">Earle Vtred deliuered pledges to Cnute.</note>

 the puissant force of his enimies, was constreined to deliuer pledges, and submit himselfe vnto Cnute. But yet was he not hereby warranted from danger, for shortlie after he was taken, and put to death, and then were his lands giuen vnto one Iricke or Iricius, whome 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ahus</emph> Egricus.</note>

 afterward Cnute did banish out of the realme, because that he did attempt to chalenge like authoritie to him in all points as Cnute himseife had. After that Cnute had subdued the Northumbers, he pursued Edmund, till he heard that he had taken London for 

<note place="marg">Cnute prepareth to beslege London. King Egelred departed this life. <emph>Simon Dun. Matth. West.</emph> He is buried in the church of S. Paul at Loudon.</note>

 his refuge, and staied there with his father. Then did Cnaute take his ships, and came about to the coasts of Kent, preparing to besiege the citie of London.</p>
<p>In the meane time, king Egelred sore worne with long sicknesse, departed this life on the 23 Aprill, being saint Georges day, or (as others say) on saint Gregories day, being the 12 of March, but I take this to be an error growen, by mistaking the feast-day of saint Gregorie for saint George. He reigned the tearme of 37 yeares. or little lesse. His bodie was buried in the church of saint Pauls, in the north Ile besids the qu*entity*er, as by a memoriall on the wall it maie appeare. He had two wiues (as before is mentioned.) By Elgina his first wife he had issue thr*entity*e sonnes, Edmund, Edwine, and Adedstane; besides one daughter named Egiua. By his second wife Emma, daughter to Richard the first of that name, duke of Normandie, and sister to Richard the second, he had two sonnes, Alfrid and Edward.</p>
<p>This Egelred (as you haue heard) had euill successe in his warres against the Danes, and besides the calamitie that fell thereby to his people, manie other miseries oppressed this land in his daies, not so much through his lacke of courage and slouthfull negligence, as by reason of his presumptuous pride, whereby he alienated the hearts of his people from him. 

<note place="marg">The pride of king Egelred alienated the harts of his people.</note>

 His affections he could not rule, but was led by them without order of reason, for he did not onlie disherit diuerse of his owne English subiects without apparant cause of offense by plaine forged cauillations; and also caused all the Danes to be murdered through his realme in one day, by some light suspicion of their euill meanings: but also gaue himseife to lecherous lusts, in abusing his bodie with naughtie strumpets, forsaking the bed of his owne lawfull wife, to the great infamie *entity* shame of that high degr*entity*e of maiestie, which by his kinglie office he bare and susteined. To conclude, he was from his tender youth more apt to idle rest, than to the exercise of warres; more giuen to pleasures of the bodie, than to anie vertues of the mind: although that toward his latter end, being growen into age, and taught by long experience of worldlie affaires, and proofe of passed miseries, he sought (though in vaine) to haue recouered the decaied state of his common wealth and countrie.</p>
<p>*entity* In this Egelreds time, and (as it is recorded by a British chronographer) in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 984, one Cadwalhon, the second sonne of Ieuaf tooke in hand the gouernance of Northwales, and first made warre with Ionauall his coosen, the sonne of Meyric, and right heire to the land, and slue him, but Edwall the yoongest brother escaped awaie priuilie. The y*entity*ere following, Meredith the sonne of Owen king or prince of Southwales, with all his power entered into Northwales, and in fight slue Cadwalhon the sonne of Ieuaf, and Meyric his brother, and conquered the land to himselfe. Wherein a man maie s*entity*e how God 

<note place="marg">S*entity*e the historie of Cambria pag. 62, 63.</note>

 punished the wrong, which Iago and Ieuaf the sonnes of Edwall Voell did to their eldest brother Meyric, who was first disherited, and afterward his eies put out, and one of his sonnes slaine. For first Ieuaf was imprisoned by Iago; then Iago with his sonne Constantine, by Howell the son of Ieuaf: and afterward the said Howell, with his brethren Cadwalhon and Meyric, were slaine and spoiled of all their lands.</p>

<p>This Edmund for his noble courage, strength of bodie, and notable patience to indure and suffer all such hardnesse and paines as is requisite in a man of warre, was surnamed Ironside, *entity* began his reigne in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 1016, in the sixt*entity*enth y*entity*ere of the emperor

After that king Edmund had receiued the crowne in the citie of London by the hands of the archbishop of Yorke, he assembled togither such a power as he could make, and with the same marched foorth towards the west parts, and made the countrie subiect to him. In the meane time was Cnute proclaimed and ordeined king at Southampton by the bishops and abbats, and

Cnute then perceiuing that he might not haue his purpose there, withdrew

 Shortlie after, king Edmund hearing that an other armie of the Danes had besieged Salisburie, marched thither to succour them within, and immediatlie Cnute followed him, so that at a

 place in Worcestershire called Scorastan, on the foure and twentith of June, they incountred togither, and fought a verie cruell battell, which at length the night parted with equall fortune. And likewise on the next day they buckled togither againe, and fought with like successe as they had doone the day before, for towards euening they gaue ouer well wearied, and not knowing to whome the victorie ought to be ascribed.</p>
<p>Wiriters haue reported, that this second day, when duke Edrike perceiued the Englishmen to be at point to haue got the vpper hand, he withdrew aside, and hauing by chance slaine a common souldier called Osmear, which in visage much resembled king Edmund, whose head he cut off, held it vp, *entity* shaking his swoord bloudie with the slaughter, cried to the Englishmen; "Flee ye wretches, flee and get awaie, for your king is dead, behold heere his head which I hold in my hands." H*entity*erewith had the Englishmen fled immediatlie, if king Edmund aduised of this stratagem, had not quicklie got him to an high ground where his men might s*entity*e him aliue and lustie. H*entity*erewith also the traitor Edrike escaped hardlie the danger of death, the Englishmen shot so egerlie at him. At length, as is said, the night parting them in sunder, they withdrew the one armie from the other, as it had b*entity*ene by consent. The third day they remained in armor, but yet absteining from battell, sate still, in taking meate and drinke to relieue their wearied bodies, and after gathered in heapes the dead carcases

 that had b*entity*ene slaine in the former fight, the number of which on either partie reckoned, rose to the point of twentie thousand and aboue.</p>
<p>In the night following, Cnute remooued his campe in secret wise, and marched towards London, which citie in a maner remained besieged by the nauie of the Danes. King Edmund in the morning when the light had discouered the departure of his enimies, followed them by the tract, and comming to London with small adoo remooued the siege, and entered the 

<note place="marg">The Danes ouercome at Prentford. <emph>Wil. Malm. Hen. Hunt. Fabian. Caxton. Polydor.</emph></note>

 citie like a conqueror. Shortlie after he fought with the Danes at Brentford, and gaue them a great ouerthrow. In this meane while queene Emma the widow of king Egelred, doubting the fortune of the warre, sent hir two sonnes Alfred and Edward ouer into Normandie vnto hir brother duke Richard, or rather fled thither hirselfe with them (as some write.)</p>
<p>Moreouer, earle Edrike, perceiuing the great manhood of king Edmund, began to feare, least in the end he should subdue and vanquish the Danes, wherefore he sought meanes to conclude a peace, and take such order with him as might stand with both their contentations, which yer long he brought about. This was doone (as you shall heare) by the consent of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hent. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Cnute (as some write) to the intent that Edrike being put in trust with king Edmund, might the more easilie deuise waies how to betraie him. But Cnute disappointed of his purpose at London, and fetching a great bootie and preie out of the countries next adioining, repared to his ships, to s*entity*e what order was amongst them, which a little before were withdrawen into

<p>King Edmund, who hated nothing woorse than to linger his businesse, assembled, his people, and marching forward toward his enimies, approched n*entity*ere vnto them, *entity* pitcht downe his tents not farre from his enimies campe, exhorting his people to remember their passed victories, and to doo their good willes, at length by one battell so to ouerthrow them, that <pb n="723"/>they might make an end of the warre, and dispatch them cleerelie out of the realme. With these and the like woords he did so incourage his souldiers, that they disdaining thus to haue the enimies dailie prouoke them, and to put them to trouble, with eger minds and fierce courages offered battell to the Danes, which Cnute had prepared to receiue whensoeuer the Englishmen approched: and heerewith bringing his men into araie, he came foorth to m*entity*et his enimies. Then was the battell begun with great earnestnesse on both sides, *entity* continued 

<note place="marg">The battell is begun.</note>

 foure houres, till at length the Danes began somewhat to shrinke, which when Cnute perceiued, he commanded his horssemen to come forward into the forepart of his dawnted host.</p>

 and of king Edmunds side, not past six hundred, and those were footmen. This battell was fought as should app*entity*ere by diuerse writers, at Okefort or Oteford. It was thought, that if king Edmund had pursued the victorie and followed in chase of his enimies in such wise as he safelie might haue doone, he had made that day an end of the warres: but he was counselled by Edrike (as some write) in no condition to follow them, but to staie and giue time to his people to refresh their wearie bodies. Then Cnute with his armie passed ouer the Thames into Essex, and there assembled all his power togither, and began to spoile and waste the countrie on each hand. King Edmund aduertised thereof, hasted foorth to succour his people, and at Ashdone in Essex three miles from Saffron Walden, gaue battell to Cnute, where after sore and cruell fight continued with great slaughter on both sides a long time, duke Edrike fled to the comfort of the Danes, and to the discomfort of the Englishmen.</p>
<p>H*entity*erevpon king Edmund was constreined in the end to depart out of the field, hauing first doone all that could be wished in a woorthie chieftaine, both by woords to incourage his men, *entity* by deeds to shew them good example; so that at one time the Danes were at point to haue giuen backe, but that Cnute aduised thereof, rushed into the left wing where most danger was, and so relieued his people there, that finallie the Englishmen, both wearied with long fight, and also discouraged with the running awaie of some of their companie, were constreined to giue ouer, and by flight to s*entity*eke their safegard, so that king Edmnund might not by anie meanes bring them againe into order.

<p>Thus made he an end, and the two princes allowed well of his last motion, and so order was taken, that they should fight togither in a singular combat within a litle Iland inclosed with the riuer of Seuerne called Oldney, with condition, that whether of them chanced to be victor, should be king, and the other to resigne his title for euer into his hands. The two princes entering into the place appointed, in faire armour, began the battell in sight of both their armies ranged in goodlie order ont either side the riuer, with doubtfull minds, and nothing ioifull, as they that wauered betwixt hope and feare. The two champions manfullie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. Westm.</emph></note>

 assailed either other, without sparing. First, they went to it on horssebacke, and after on <pb n="725"/>foot. Cnute was a man of a meane stature, but yet strong and hardie, so that receiuing a 

<note place="marg">Cnute of what stature he was.</note>

 great blow by the hand of his aduersarie, which caused him somewhat to stagger; yet recouered himselfe, and boldly stept forward to be reuenged. But perceiuing he could not find aduantage, and that he was rather too weake, and shrewdlie ouermatched, he spake to 

<note place="marg">Cnute ouermatched. Cnutes woords to Edmund.</note>

 Edmund with a lowd voice on this wise: "What necessitie (saith he) ought thus to mooue vs, most valiant prince, that for the obteining of a kingdome, we should thus put our liues in danger? Better were it that laieng armour and malice aside, we should condescend to some reasonable agreement. Let vs become sworne brethren, and part the kingdome betwixt vs: and let vs deale so friendlie, that thou maist vse my things as thine owne, and 

<note place="marg"><emph>H. Hunt.</emph></note>

 I thine as though they were mine." King Edmund with those woords of his aduersarie was so pacified, that immediatlie he cast awaie his swoord, and comming to Cnute, ioined hands with him. Both the armies by their example did the like, which looked for the 

<note place="marg">They make vp the matter betwixt themselues.</note>

 same fortune to fall on their countries, which should happen to their princes by the successe of that one battell. After this, there was an agreement deuised betwixt them, so that a partition of the realme was made, and that part that lieth fore against France, was assigned to Edmund, and the other fell to Cnute. There be that write, how the offer was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wit. Malm.</emph></note>

 made by king Edmund for the auoiding of more bloudshed, that the two princes should trie the matter thus togither in a singular combat. But Cnute refused the combat, bicause (as he alledged) the match was not equall. For although he was able to match Edmund in boldnesse of stomach, yet was he farre too weake to deale with a man of such strength as Edmund was knowne to be. But sith they did pretend title to the realme by due and good direct meanes, he thought it most conuenient that the kingdome should be diuided betwixt them. This motion was allowed of both the armies, so that king Edmund was of force constreined to be contented therewith.</p>
<p>*entity* Thus our common writers haue recorded of this agreement, but if I should not be thought presumptuous, in taking vpon me to reprooue, or rather but to mistrust that which hath b*entity*ene receiued for a true narration in this matter, I would rather giue credit vnto that which the author of the booke intituled "Encomium Emmaae," dooth report in this behalfe. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Encomium Emmae.</emph></note>

 Which is that through persuasion of Edrike de Streona, king Edmund immediatelie after the battell fought at Ashdone, sent ambassadors vnto Cnute to offer vnto him peace, with halfe the realme of England, that is to say, the north parts, with condition that king Edmund might quietlie inioy the south parts, and therevpon haue pledges deliuered interchangeablie on either side.</p>
<p>Cnute hauing heard the effect of this message, staied to make answer till he heard what his councell would aduise him to doo in this behalfe: and vpon good deliberation taken in the matter, considering that he had lost no small number of people in the former battell. and that being farre out of his countrie, he could not well haue anie new supplie, where the Englishmen although they had likewise lost verie manie of their men of warre, yet being in their owne countrie, it should be an easie matter for them to restore their decaid number, it was thought expedient by the whole consent of all the Danish capteins, that the offer of king Edmund should be accepted.</p>
<p>Herevpon Cnute calling the ambassadors before him againe, declared vnto them, that he was contented to conclude a peace vpon such conditions as they had offered: but yet with this addition, that their king whatsoeuer he should be, should paie Cnutes souldiers their wages, with monie to be leuied of that part of the kingdome which the English king should possesse. "For (this saith he) I haue vndertaken to s*entity*e them paid, and otherwise I will not grant to anie peace." The league and agr*entity*ement therefore being concluded in this sort, pledges were deliuered and receiued on both parties, and the armies discharged. But God (saith mine author) being mindfull of his old doctrine, that Euerie kingdome diuided 

<note place="marg">This is alleged touching the partiti*entity* of the kingdome.</note>

 in it selfe cannot long stand, shortlie after tooke Edmund out of this life: and by such meanes s*entity*emed to take pitie of the English kingdome, lest if both the kings should haue continued in life togither, they should haue hiued in danger. And incontinentlie herevpon <pb n="726"/>was Cnute chosen and receiued for absolute king of all the whole realme of England. Thus hath he written that liued in those daies, whose credit thereby is much aduanced.</p>
<p>Howbeit the common report of writers touching the death of Edmund varieth from this, who doo affirme, that after Cnute and Edmund were made friends, the serpent of enuie and false conspiracie burnt so in the hearts of some traitorous persons, that within a while after 

<note place="marg">K. Edmund traitorouslie slaine at Oxford. <emph>Fabian. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 king Edmund was slaine at Oxford, as he sat on a priuie to doo the necessaries of nature. The common report hath gone, that earle Edrike was the procurer of this villanous act, and that (as some write) his sonne did it. But the author that wrote "Encomium Emmae," writing of the death of Edmund, hath these words (immediatlie after he had first declared in what sort the two princes were agr*entity*ed, and had made partition of the realme betwixt 

<note place="marg">This is alleged againe for the proofe of Edmunds natural death.</note>

 them:) But God (saith he) being mindfull of his old doctrine, that Euerie kingdome diuided in it selfe can not long stand, shortlie after tooke Edmund out of this life: and by such meanes s*entity*emed to take pitie vpon the English kingdome, least if both the kings should haue continued in life togither, they should both haue liued in great danger, and the realme in trouble. With this agreeth also Simon Dunel. who saith, that king Edmund died of naturall 

<note place="marg"><emph>Fabian.</emph></note>

 sicknesse, by course of kind at London, about the feast of saint Andrew next insuing the late mentioned agreement.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ranul. Hig.</emph></note>

<p>And this should s*entity*eme true: for whereas these authors which report, that earle Edrike 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 was the procurer of his death, doo also write, that when he knew the act to be done, he hasted vnto Cnute, and declared vnto him what he had brought to passe for his aduancement to the gouernment of the whole realme. Wherevpon Cnute, abhorring such a detestable fact, said vnto him: "Bicause thou hast for my sake, made away the worthiest bodie of the world, I shall raise thy head aboue all the lords of England," and so caused him 

<note place="marg">Some thinke that he was duke of Mercia before, and now had Essex adioined thereto.</note>

 to be put to death. Thus haue some bookes. Howbeit this report agreeth not with other writers, which declare how Cnute aduanced Edrike in the beginning of his reigne vnto high honor, and made him gouernor of Mercia, and vsed his counsell in manie things after the death of king Edmund, as in banishing Edwin, the brother of king Edmund, with his sonnes also, Edmund and Edward.</p>

<note place="marg">Diuerse and discordant reports of Edmunds death. <emph>Ran. Higd. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

<p>But for that there is such discordance and variable report amongst writers touching the death of king Edmund, and some fables inuented thereof (as the manner is) we will let the residue of their reports passe; sith certeine it is, that to his end he came, after he had reigned about the space of one y*entity*ere, and so much more as is betw*entity*ene the moneth of Iune and the latter end of Nouember. His bodie was buried at Glastenburie, neere his vncle Edgar. With this Edmund, surnamed Ironside, fell the glorious maiestie of the English kingdome, the which afterward as it had beene an aged bodie being sore decaied and weakened by the Danes, that now got possession of the whole, yet somewhat recouered after the space of 26 y*entity*ers vnder king Edward, surnamed the Confessor: and shortlie therevpon as it had b*entity*ene falne into a resiluation, came to extreame ruine by the inuasion and conquest of the Normans: as after by Gods good helpe and fauorable assistance it shall appeare. So that it would make a diligent and marking reader both muse and moorne, to see how variable the state of this kingdome hath b*entity*ene, *entity* thereby to fall into a consideration of the frailtie and vncerteintie of this mortall life, which is no more fr*entity*e from securitie than a ship on the sea in tempestuous weather. For as the casualties wherewith our life is inclosed and beset with round about, are manifold; so also are they miserable, so also are they sudden, so also are they vnauoidable. And true it is, that the life of man is in the hands of God, and the state of kingdoms dooth also belong vnto him, either to continue or discontinue. But to the processe of the matter.</p>

Cnute shortlie after the death of king Edmund, assembled a councell at London, in the which he caused all the nobles of the realme to doo him homage, in receiuing an oth of loiall obeisance. He diuided the realme into foure parts, assigning Northumberland vnto the rale of Irke or Iricius, Mercia vnto Edrike, and Eastangle vnto Turkill, and reseruing the west part to his owne gouernance. He banished (as before is said) Edwin, the brother of king Edmund; but such as were suspected to be culpable of Edmunds death, he caused to be put to execution: whereby it should appeere, that Edrike was not then in anie wise detected or once thought to be giltie.</p>
<p>The said Edwin afterwards returned, and was then reconciled to the kings fauor (as some

 of conscience sent them into Hungarie, where they found great fauor at the hands of king Salomon, insomuch that Edwin maried the daughter of the same Salomon, but had no issue by hir. Edward was aduanced to marie with Agatha, daughter of the emperour Henrie, and by hir had issue two sonnes, Edmund and Edgar surnamed Edeling, and as many daughters, Margaret and Christine, of the which in place conuenient more shall be said.</p>
<p>When king Cnute had established things, as he thought stood most for his suertie, he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> King Cnute maried to qu*entity*ene Emma the widow of Egelred, in Iulie, anno. 1017. <emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 called to his remembrance, that he had no issue but two bastard sonnes Harold and Sweno, begotten of his concubine Alwine. Wherefore he sent ouer to Richard duke of Normandie, requiring to haue qu*entity*ene Emma, the widow of king Egelred in mariage, and so obteined hir, not a little to the woonder of manie, which thought a great ouersight both in the woman and in hir brother, that would satisfie the request of Cnute herein, considering he had b*entity*ene such a mortall enimie to hir former husband. But duke Richard did not onelie consent, that his said sister should be maried vnto Cnute, but also he himselfe tooke to wife the ladie Hestritha, sister to the said Cnute.</p>
<p>*entity* Here ye haue to vnderstand, that this mariage was not made without great consideration *entity* large couenants granted on the part of king Cnute: for before he could obteine queene 

<note place="marg">The couenants made at the mariage betwixt Cnute and Emma.</note>

 Emma to his wife, it was fullie condescended *entity* agr*entity*ed, that after Cnuts decease, the crowne of England should remaine to the issue borne of this mariage betwixt hir *entity* Cnute, which couenant although it was not performed immediatlie after the deceasse of king Cnute, yet in the end it tooke place, so as the right s*entity*emed to be deferred, and not to be taken away <pb n="728"/>nor abolished: for immediatlie vpon Harolds death that had vsurped, Hardicnute succ*entity*eded as right heire to the crowne, by force of the agr*entity*ement made at the time of the mariage solemnized betwixt his father and mother, and being once established in the kingdome, he ordeined his brother Edward to succ*entity*ed him, whereby the Danes were vtterlie excluded from all right that they had to pretend vnto the crowne of this land, and th English bloud restored thereto, chieflie by that gratious conclusion of this mariage betwixt king Cnute and

 qu*entity*ene Emma. For the which no small praise was thought to be due vnto the said qu*entity*ene, sith by hir politike gouernement, in making hir match so benenficiall to hir selfe and hir line, the crowne was thus recouered out of the hands of the Danes, and restored againe in time to the right heire, as by an auncient treatise which some haue intituled "Encomium Emmae," and was written in those dales, it dooth and may appeare. Which booke although there be but few copies thereof abroad, giueth vndoubtedlie great light to the historie of that time.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

<p>But now to our purpose. Cnute the same yeare in which he was thus maried, through persuasion of his wife qu*entity*ene Emma, sent awaie the Danish nauie and armie home into Denmarke, giuing to them fourescore and two thousand pounds of siluer, which was leuied 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wd. Malm.</emph></note>

 throughout this land for their wages. In the yeare 1018, Edrike de Streona earle of Mercia 

<note place="marg"><date>1018.</date></note>

 was ouerthrowen in his owne turne: for being called before the king into his priuie chamber, and there in reasoning the matter about some quarrell that was picked to him, he began verie presumptuouslie to vpbraid the king of such pleasures as he had before time doone vnto him; "I did (said he) for the loue which I bare towards you, forsake my souereigne lord king Edmund, and at length for your sake slue him." At which words Cnute began to change countenance, as one maruellouslie abashed, and straightwaies gaue sentence against Edrike in this wise; "Thou art woorthie (saith he) of death, and die thou shalt, which art guiltie of treason both towards God and me, sith that thou hast slaine thine own souereigne lord, and my d*entity*ere alied brother. Thy bloud therefore be vpon thine owne head, sith thy toong hath vttered thy treason." And immediatlie he caused his throat to be cut, and his bodie to be throwen out at the chamber window into the riuer of Thames. *entity* But 

<note place="marg">Edrike put to death.</note>

 others say, that hands were laid vpon him in the verie same chamber or closet where he murdered the king, *entity* straightwaies to preuent all causes of tumults *entity* hurlieburlies, he was put to death with terrible torments of fierbrands *entity* links; which execution hauing passed vpon him, a second succeeded; for both his f*entity*et were bound together, and his bodie drawne through the streets of the citie, *entity* in fine cast into a common ditch called Houndsditch; for that the citizens threw their dead dogs and stinking carrion with other filth into it, accounting him worthie of a worse rather than of a better buriall. In such hatred was treason had, being a vice which the verie infidels and grosse pagans abhorred, else would they not haue said, <emph>Proditionem, amo, proditorem odi;</emph> Treason I loue, but a traitor I hate. This was the end of Edrike, surnamed de Stratten or Streona, a man of great infamie for his craftie dissimulation, falshood and treason, vsed by him to the ouerthrow of the English estate, as partlie before is touched.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun. Encomium Emmae.</emph></note>

<p>But there be that concerning the cause of this Edriks death, s*entity*eme partlie to disagr*entity*e from that which before is recited, declaring that Cnute standing in some doubt to be betraied through the treason of Edrike, sought occasion how to rid him and others (whome he mistrusted) out of the way. And therefore on a day when Edrike craued some preferment at Cnuts hands, *entity* said that he had deserued to be well thought of, sith by his flight from the battell at Ashendon, the victorie therby inclined to Cnutes part: Cnute hearing him speake these words, made this answere: "And canst thou (quoth he) be true to me, that through fraudulent meanes diddest deceiue thy so*entity*ereigne lord and maister? But I will reward th*entity*e according to thy deserts, so as from henceforth thou shalt not deceiue anie other," and so forthwith commanded Erike one of his chiefe capteines to dispatch him, who incontinentlie cut off his head with his axe or halbert. Verelie Simon Dunelmensis saith, that K. Cnute vnderstanding in what sort both king Egelred, and his sonne king Edmund Ironside had b*entity*ene betraied by the said Edrike, stood in great doubt to be likewise deceiued by him, and <pb n="729"/>therefore was glad to haue some pretended quarell, to dispatch both him and others, whome he likewise mistrusted, as it well appeared. For at the same time there were put to death with Edrike earle Norman the sonne of earle Leofwin, and brother to earle Leofrike: also Adelward the sonne of earle Agelmare and Brightrike the sonne of Alfegus gouernor of Deuonshire, without all guilt or cause (as some write.) And in place of Norman, his brother Leofrike was made earle of Mercia by the king, and had in great fauour. This Leofrike is commonlie also by writers named earle of Chester. After this, Cnute likewise banished Iric and Turkill, two Danes, the one (as before is recited) gouernor of Northumberland, and the other of Northfolke and Suffolke or Eastangle.</p>
<p>Then rested the whole rule of the realme in the kings hands, wherevpon he studied to preserue the people in peace, and ordeined lawes, according to the which both Danes and Englishmen should be gouerned in equall state and degr*entity*e. Diuers great lords whome he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph> Lords pat to death.</note>

 found vnfaithfull or rather suspected, he put to death (as before ye haue heard) beside such as he banished out of the realme He raised a tax or tribute of the people, amounting to the summe of fourescore *entity* two thousand pounds, besides 11000 pounds, which the Londoners 

<note place="marg">A taxe raised.</note>

 paid towards the maintenance of the Danish armie. But whereas these things chaunced not all at one time, but in sundrie seasons, we will returne somewhat backe to declare what other exploits were atchiued in the meane time by Cnute, not onelie in England, but also in Denmarke, and elsewhere: admonishing the reader in the processe of the discourse following, that much excellent matter is comprehended, whereout (if the same be studiouslie read and diligentlie considered) no small profit is to be reaped, both for the augmentation of his owne knowledge and others that be studious.</p>

In the morning earlie, when as Cnute heard that the Englishmen were gone foorth of their lodgings, he supposed that they were either fled awaie, or else turned to take part with the enimies. But as he approched to the enimies campe, he vnderstood how the mater went; for he found nothing there but bloud, dead bodies, and the spoile. For which good seruice, Cnute had the Englishmen

Herevpon Olauus was sore offended in his mind against Cnute, and now vpon occasion sought to be reuenged.

 aduanced in these warres, as well against the Swedeners as the Norwegians, so that Cnute began to loue and trust the Englishmen much better than it was to be thought he would euer haue doone. Shortlie after that Cnute was returned into England, that is to say (as some haue) in the 15 yeare of his reigne, he went to Rome to performe his vow which he had made to visit the places where the apostles Peter and Paule had their buriall, where he was honorablie receiued of pope Iohn the 20 that then held the s*entity*e. When he had doone his deuotion 

<note place="marg"><date>1032.</date></note>

 there, he returned into England. In the yeare following, he made a iournie against the Scots,

 which as then had rebelled; but by the princelie power of Cnute they were subdued and

 brought againe to obedience: so that not onelie king Malcolme, but also two other kings Melbeath and Ieohmare became his subiects. Finallie after that this noble prince king Cnute

<note place="marg">The large deminion of K. Cnute. <emph>Hen. Hunt. Alb. Crantz.</emph></note>

<p>THIS Cnute was the mightiest prince that euer reigned ouer the English people: for he had the souereigne rule ouer all Denmark, England, Norwaie, Scotland, and part of Sweiden. Amongest other of his roiall acts, he caused such tolles and tallages as were demanded of way-goers at bridges and str*entity*ets in the high way betwixt England and Rome to be diminished <pb n="731"/>to the halfes, and againe got also a moderation to be had in the paiment of the archbishops fees of his realme, which was leuied of them in the court of Rome when they should receiue their palles, as may appeare by a letter which he himselfe being at Rome, directed to the bishops and other of the nobles of England. In the which it also appeareth, that besides the roiall interteinment, which he had at Rome of pope Iohn, he had conference there with the emperour Conrad, with Rafe the king of Burgongne, and manie other great princes and noble men, which were present there at that time: all which at his request, in fauour 

<note place="marg">Grants made to the benefit of Englishment, at the instance of king Cnute. <emph>Fabian. Polydor. Matt. West.</emph> He caused his chaire to be set there, as <emph>Matth. West.</emph> saith. <emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 of those Englishmen that should trauell vnto Rome, granted (as we haue said) to diminish such duties as were gathered of passingers.</p>
<p>He receiued there manie great gifts of the emperour, and was highlie honored of him, and likewise of the pope, and of all other the high princes at that time present at Rome: so that when he came home (as some write) he did grow greatlie into pride, insomuch that being n*entity*ere to the Thames, or rather (as other write) vpon the sea strand, n*entity*ere to Southhampton, and perceiuing the water to rise by reason of the tide, he cast off his gowne, and wrapping it round togither, threw it on the sands verie neere the increasing water, and sat him downe vpon it, speaking these or the like words to the sea: "Thou art (saith he) within the compasse of my dominion, and the ground whereon I sit is mine, and thou knowest that no wight dare disobeie my commandements; I therefore doo now command th*entity*e not to rise vpon my ground, nor to presume to wet anie part of thy souereigne lord and gouernour." But the sea k*entity*eping hir course, rose still higher and higher, and ouerflowed not onelie the kings f*entity*et, but also flashed vp vnto his legs and knees. Wherewith the king started suddenlie vp, and withdrew from it, saieng withall to his nobles that were about him: "Behold you noble 

<note place="marg">The saieng of king Cnute.</note>

 men, you call me king, which can not so much as staie by my commandement this small portion of water. But know ye for certeine, that there is no king but the father onelie of our Lord Iesus Christ, with whome he reigneth, *entity* at whose becke all things are gouerned. Let vs 

<note place="marg">Zealouslie inough, if it had bin according to true knowledge.</note>

 therefore honor him, let vs confesse and professe him to be the ruler of heauen, earth, and sea, and besides him none other."</p>
<p>From thence he went to Winchester, and there with his owne hands set his crowne vpon the head of the image of the crucifix, whichstood there in the church of the apostles Peter and Paule, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd. Polydor. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 and from thenceforth he would neuer weare that crowne nor anie other. Some write that he spake not the former words to the sea vpon anie presumptuousnesse of mind, but onelie vpon occasion of the vaine title, which in his commendation one of his gentlemen gaue him by way 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 of flatterie (as he rightlie tooke it) for he called him the most mightiest king of all kings, 

<note place="marg">Flatterie reproued.</note>

 which ruled most at large both men, sea, and land. Therefore to reprooue the fond flatterie of such vaine persons, he deuised and practised the d*entity*ed before mentioned, thereby both to reprooue such flatterers, and also that men might be admonished to consider the omnipotencie of almightie God. He had issue by his wife qu*entity*ene Emma, a sonne named by the English chronicles Hardiknought, but by the Danish writers Canute or Knute: also a daughter named Gonilda, that was after maried to Henrie the sonne of Conrad, which also was afterwards 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 emperour, and named Henrie the third. By his concubine Alwine that was daughter 

<note place="marg"><emph>Alb. Crantz.</emph></note>

 to Alselme, whome some name earle of Hampton, he had two bastard sonnes, Harold and Sweno. He was much giuen in his latter daies to vertue, as he that considered how perfect 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor. Fabian.</emph></note>

 felicitie rested onelie in godlines and true deuotion to serue the heauenlie king and gouernour of all things.</p>
<p>He repared in his time manie churches, abbeies and houses of religion, which by occasion of warres had b*entity*ene sore defaced by him and his father, but speciallie he did great cost vpon the abbeie of saint Edmund, in the towne of Burie, as partlie before is mentioned. He also built two abbeies from the foundation, as saint Benets in Norffolke, seuen miles distant from Norwich, and an other in Norwaie. He did also build a church at Ashdone in Essex, 

<note place="marg">Which is supposed to be Baiclow: for Ashdone it selfe is halfe a mile from thence.</note>

 where he obteined the victorie of king Edmund, and was present at the hallowing or consecration therof with a great multitude of the lords and nobles of the realme, both English and Danes. He also holpe with his owne hands to remooue the bodie of the holie archbishop <pb n="732"/>

<p>Thus did Cnute striue to reforme all such things as he and his ancestors had doone amisse, and to wipe awaie the spot of euill dooing, as suerlie to the outward sight of the world he did in deed; he had the archbishop of Canturburie Achelnotus in singular reputation, and vsed his

 counsell in matters of importance. He also highlie fauoured Leofrike earle of Chester, so that the same Leofrike bare great rule in ordering of things touching the state of the common

 wealth vnder him as one of his chiefe councellors. Diuerse lawes and statutes he made for the gouernment of the common wealth, partlie agr*entity*eable with the lawes of king Edgar, and other the kings that were his predecessors, and partlie tempered according to his owne liking, and as was thought to him most expedient: among the which there be diuerse that concerne causes as well ecclesiasticall as temporall. Whereby (as maister Fox hath noted) it maie be gathered, that the gouernment of spiritual matters did depend then not vpon the bishop of Rome, but rather apperteined vnto the lawfull authoritie of the temporall prince, no lesse than matters and causes temporall. But of these lawes *entity* statutes enacted by king Cnute, ye may read more as ye find them set foorth in the before remembred booke of maister William Lambert, which for briefenesse we h*entity*ere omit.</p>

<p>AFTER that Cnute was departed this life, there arose much variance amongst the peeres and great lords of the realme about the succession. The Danes and Londoners (which through continuall familiaritie with the Danes, were become like vnto them) elected Harold the 

<note place="marg">Controuersie for the crowne.</note>

 base sonne of king Cnute, to succ*entity*ed in his fathers roome, hauing earle Leofrike, and diuerse other of the noble men of the north parts on their side. But other of the Englishmen, and namelie earle Goodwine earle of Kent, with the chiefest lords of the west parts, coueted rather to haue one of king Egelreds sonnes, which were in Normandie, or else Hardicnute the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 sonne of king Cnute by his wife qu*entity*ene Emma, which remained in Denmarke, aduanced to

 the place. This controuersie held in such wise, that the realme was diuided (as some write) by lot betwixt the two brethren Harold and Hardicnute. The north part, as Mercia and Northumberland fell to Harold, and the south part vnto Hardicnute: but at length the whole remained: vnto Harold, bicause his brother Hardicnute refused to come out of Denmarke to take the gouernment vpon him.</p>

<pb n="733"/>
<p>But yet the authoritie of earle Goodwine, who had the queene and the treasure of the

 realme in his k*entity*eping, staied the matter a certeine time, (professing himselfe as it were gardian to the yoong men, the sonnes of the qu*entity*ene, till at length he was constreined to giue ouer his hold, and conforme himselfe to the stronger part and greater number.) And so at Oxford, where the assemblie was holden about the election, Harold was proclaimed king, and consecrated according to the maner (as some write.) But it should appeere by other, that Elnothus 

<note place="marg">The refusall of the archbishop Elnothus to consecrate king Harold.</note>

 the archbishop of Canturburie, a man indued with all vertue and wisedome, refused to crowne him: for when king Harold being elected of the nobles and p*entity*eres, required the said archbishop that he might be of him consecrated, and receiue at his hands the regall scepter with the crowne, which the archbishop had in his custodie, and to whome it onelie did apperteine to inuest him therewith, the archbishop flatlie refused, and with an oth protested, that he would not consecrate anie other for king, so long as the qu*entity*enes children liued: "for (saith he) Cnute committed them to my trust and assurance, and to them will I k*entity*epe my faith and loiall obedience. The scepter and crowne I h*entity*ere lay downe vpon the altar, and neither doo I denie nor deliuer them vnto you: but I forbid by the apostolike authoritie all the bishops, that none of them presume to take the same awaie, and deliuer them to you, or consecrate you for king. As for your selfe, if you dare, you maie vsurpe that which I haue committed vnto God and his table."</p>
<p>But whether afterwards the king by one meane or other, caused the archbishop to crowne him king, or that he was consecrated of some other, he was admitted king of all the English people, beginning his reigne in the y*entity*ere of our Lord a thousand thirtie and six, in the fouretenth 

<note place="marg"><date>1036.</date></note>

 y*entity*ere of the emperor Conrad the second, in the sixt y*entity*ere of Henrie the first, king of France, and about the seuen and twentith y*entity*ere of Malcolme the second, king of Scots. This 

<note place="marg">Harold why he is surnamed Harefoot.</note>

 Harold for his great swiftnesse, was surnamed Harefoot, of whome little is written touching his dooings, sauing that he is noted to haue b*entity*ene an oppressor of his people, and spotted with manie notable vices. It was spoken of diuerse in those daies, that this Harold was not the sonne 

<note place="marg">Harold euill spoken of. <emph>Ran. Higd. ex Mariano.</emph></note>

 of Cnute, but of a shoomaker, and that his supposed mother Elgina, king Cnutes concubine, to bring the king further in loue with hir, feined that she was with child: and about the time that she should be brought to bed (as she made hir account) caused the said shoomakers son to be secretlie brought into hir chamber, and then vntrulie caused it to be reported that she was deliuered, and the child so reputed to be the kings sonne.</p>
<p>Immediatlie vpon aduertisement had of Cnutes death, Alfred the sonne of king Egelred, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 with fiftie saile landed at Sandwich, meaning to challenge the crowne, and to obteine it by lawfull claime with quietnesse, if he might; if not, then to vse force by aid of his friends, and to assaie that waie foorth to win it, if he might not otherwise obteine it. From Sandwich he came to Canturburie: and shortlie after, earle Goodwine feining to receiue him as a friend, came to meet him, and at Gilford in the night season appointed a number of armed men to fall vpon the Normans as they were asl*entity*epe, and so tooke them togither with Alfred, *entity* slue the Normans by the poll, in such wise that nine were slaine, *entity* the tenth reserued. But yet when those that were reserued, seemed to him a greater number than he wished to escape, he fell to and againe tithed them as before. Alfred had his eies put out, and was conueied to the Ile of Elie, where shortlie after he died.</p>
<p>*entity* How Alfred should claime the crowne to himselfe I see not: for verelie I can not be persuaded 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd.</emph></note>

 that he was the elder brother, though diuers authors haue so written, sith Gemeticensis, *entity* the author of the booke called "Encomium Emma," plainlie affirme, that Edward was the elder: but it might be, that Alfred being a man of a stouter stomach than his brother Edward, made this attempt, either for himselfe, or in the behalfe of his brother Edward, being 

<note place="marg">S*entity*e maister <emph>Fox</emph> acts and monnments, pag. 112. <emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 as then absent, and gone into Hungarie, as some write: but other say, that as well Edward as Alfred came ouer at this time with a number of Norman knights, and men of warre imbarked in a few ships, onelie to speake with their mother, who as then lay at Winchester, whether to take aduise with hir how to recouer their right heere in this land, or to aduance their brother Hardicnute, or for some other purpose, our authors doo not declare.</p>

<pb n="734"/>
<p>But the lords of the realme that bare their good wils vnto Harold, and (though contrarie to right) ment to mainteine him in the estate, seemed to be much offended with the comming of these two brethren in such order: for earle Goodwine persuaded them, that it was great danger to suffer so manie strangers to enter the realme, as they had brought with them. Wherevpon earle Goodwine with the assent of the other lords, or rather by commandement of Harold, went foorth, and at Gilford met with Alfred that was comming towards king Harold to speake with him, accordinglie as he was of Harold required to doo. But now being taken, and his companie miserablie murthered (as before ye haue heard) to the number of six hundred Normans, Alfred himselfe was sent into the Ile of Elie, there to remaine in the abbeie in custodie of the moonks, hauing his eies put out as soone as he entered first into the same Ile. William Malmesburie saith, that Alfred came ouer, and was thus handeled betwixt the time of Harolds death, *entity* the comming in of Hardicnute. Others write, that this chanced in his brother Hardicnuts daies, which s*entity*emeth not to be true: for Hardicnute was knowne to loue his brethren by his mothers side too dearelie to haue suffered anie such iniurie to be wrought against either of them in his time.</p>
<p>*entity* Thus ye s*entity*e how writers dissent in this matter, but for the better clearing of the truth touching the time, I haue thought good to shew also what the author of the said booke intituled "Encomium Emmae" writeth hereof, which is as followeth. When Harold was once established king, he sought meanes how to rid qu*entity*ene Emma out of the way, and that secretlie, for that openlie as yet he durst not attempt anie thing against hir. She in silence kept hir selfe quiet, looking for the end of these things. But Harold remembring himselfe, of a malicious purpose, by wicked aduise tooke counsell how he might get into his hands and make away the sons of qu*entity*ene Emma, *entity* so to be out of danger of all annoiance that by them might be procured against him. Wherefore he caused a letter to be written in the name of their 

<note place="marg">A counterfet letter,</note>

 mother Emma, which he sent by certeine messengers suborned for the same purpose into Normandie, where Edward and Alfred as then remained. The tenour of which letter here insueth.</p>

<p>These letters were deliuered vnto such as were made priuie to the purposed treason, who being fullie instructed how to deale, went ouer into Normandie, and presenting the letters vnto the yoong gentlemen, vsed the matter so, that they thought verelie that this message had b*entity*ene sent from their mother, and wrote againe by them that brought the letters, that one of them would not faile but come ouer vnto hir according to that she had requested, and withall appointed the day and time. The messengers returning to king Harold, informed him how they had sped. The yoonger brother Alfred, with his brothers consent, tooke with him a certeine number of gentlemen and men of warre, and first came into Flanders, where after he had remained a while with earle Baldwine, he increased his retinue with a few Bullogners, and passed ouer into England, but approching to the shore, he was streightwaies descried by his enimies, who hasted foorth to set vpon him; but perceiuing their drift, he bad the ships cast about, and make againe to the sea; then landing at an other place, he ment to go the next way to his mother.</p>
<p>But earle Goodwine hearing of his arriuall, met him, receiued him into his assurance, and 

<note place="marg">Goodwin was suspected to do this vnder a colour to betray him as by writers it s*entity*emeth.</note>

 binding his credit with a corporall oth, became his man, and therwith leading him out of the high way that leadeth to London, he brought him to Gilford, where he lodged all the strangers, by a score, a doozen, and halfe a score togither in innes, so as but a few remained about the yoong gentleman Alfred to attend vpon him. There was plentie of meat and drinke prepared in euerie lodging, for the refreshing of all the companie. And Goodwine taking his leaue for that night, departed to his lodging, promising the next morning to come againe to giue his dutifull attendance on Alfred.</p>
<p>But behold, after they had filled themselues with meats and drinks, and were gone to bed, in the dead of the night came such as king Harold had appointed, and entring into euerle inne, 

<note place="marg">Not onelie Goodwine but other such as king Harold appointed, took. Alfred with his Normans.</note>

 first seized vpon the armor and weapons that belonged to the strangers: which done, they tooke them, and chained them fast with fetters and manacles, so k*entity*eping them sure till the next morning. Which being come, they were brought foorth with their hands bound behind their backs, and deliuered to most cruell tormentors, who were commanded to spare none but euerie tenth man, as he came to hand by lot, and so they slue nine and left the tenth aliue. Of those that were left aliue, some they kept to serue as bondmen, other for couetousnesse of gaine they sold, and some they put in prison, of whome yet diuerse afterwards escaped. This with more hath the foresaid author written of this matter, declaring further, that Alfred being conueied into the Ile of Elie, had not onelie his eies put out in most cruell wise, but was also presentlie there murthered. But he speaketh not further of the maner how he was made away, sauing that he saith he forbeareth to make long recitall of this matter, bicause he will not renew the mothers gr*entity*efe in hearing it, sith there can be no greater sorrow to the mother than to heare of hir sonnes death.</p>
<p>*entity* I remember in Caxton we read, that his cruell tormentors should cause his bellie to be opened, *entity* taking out one end of his bowels or guts, tied the same to a stake which they had set fast in the ground; then with n*entity*edels of iron pricking his bodie, they caused him to run about the stake, till he had woond out all his intrailes, *entity* so ended he his innocent life, to the great shame *entity* obloquie of his cruel aduersaries. But whether he was thus tormented or not, or rather died (as I thinke) of the anguish by putting out his eies, no doubt but his death was reuenged by Gods hand in those that procured it. But whether erle Goodwine was ch*entity*efe causer thereof, in betraieng him vnder a cloked colour of pretended fr*entity*endship, I cannot say: but that he tooke him and slue his companie, as some haue written, I cannot thinke it to be true, both as well for that which ye haue heard recited out of the author that wrote "Encomium Emmae," as also for that it should s*entity*eme he might neuer be so directlie charged with it, but that he had matter to alledge in his owne excuse. But now to other affaires of Harold.</p>

 Harold in the kingdome. Moreouer, Harold made small account of his subiects, degenerating from the noble vertues of his father, following him in few things (except in exacting of tributes and paiments.) He caused indeed eight markes of siluer to be leuied of euerie port or hauen in England, to the reteining of 16 ships furnished with men of warre, which continued euer in readinesse to defend the coasts from pirats. To conclude with this Harold, his sp*entity*edie death prouided well for his fame, bicause (as it was thought) if his life had b*entity*ene of long continuance, his infamie had b*entity*ene the greater. But after he had reigned foure y*entity*eres, or (as other gathered) three y*entity*eres and thr*entity*e moneths, he departed out of this world at Oxford, *entity* was buried at Winchester (as some say.) Other say he died at Meneford in the moneth of Aprill, and was buried at Westminster, which should appeare to be true by that which after is reported of his brother Hardiknoughts cruell dealing, and great spite shewed toward his dead bodie, as after shall he specified.</p>

<note place="marg">HARDINUTE, or HARDIKNOUGHT.</note>

<p>AFTER that Harold was dead, all the nobles of the realme, both Danes and Englishmen agr*entity*ed to send for Hardiknought, the sonne of Canute by his wife qu*entity*ene Emma, and to make him king. H*entity*ere is to be noted, that by the death of king Canute, the state of things was much altered in those countries of beyond the seas wherein he had the rule and dominion. 

<note place="marg">Alteration in the state of things. <emph>Simon Dun. *entity* Matt. West.</emph> say, that he was at Bruges in Flanders with his mother when he was thus sent for, being come thither to visit hir.</note>

 For the Norwegians elected one Magnus, the sonne of Olauus to be their king, and the Danes chose this Hardiknought, whome their writers name Canute the third, to be their gouernor. This Hardiknought or Canute being aduertised of the death of his halfe brother Harold, and that the lords of England had chosen him to their king, with all conuenient speed prepared a nauie, and imbarking a certeine number of men of warre, tooke the sea, and had the wind so fauorable for his purpose, that he arriued vpon the coast of Kent the sixt day after he set out of Denmarke, and so comming to London, was ioifullie receiued, and proclaimed king, and crowned of Athelnotus archbishop of Canturburie, in the yere of our Lord 1041, in the first y*entity*ere of the emperour Henrie the third, in the 9 yeere of Henrie the first of that name king of 

<note place="marg"><date>1041.</date></note>

 France, and in the first y*entity*ere of Magfinloch, ali*entity*s Machabeda king of Scotland. Incontinentlie after his establishment in the rule of this realme, he sent into Flanders for his mother queene

 Emma, who during the time of hir banishment, had remained there. For Normandie in that season was gouerned by the French king, by reason of the minoritie of duke William, surnamed the bastard.</p>

<pb n="737"/>
<p>Moreouer, in reuenge of the wrong offered to qu*entity*ene Emma by hir sonnie in law Harold, king Hardicnute did cause Alfrike archbishop of Yorke and earle Goodwaine with other noble 

<note place="marg">The bodie of king Harold taken vp, and throwen into Thames.</note>

 men to go to Westminster, and there to take vp the bodie of the same Harold, and withall appointed, that the head thereof should be striken off, and the trunke or it cast into the riuer of Thames. Which afterwards being found by fishers, was taken vp and buried in the churchyard of S. Clement Danes without Temple barre at London. He comnmitted the order 

<note place="marg">S. Clement Danes.</note>

 and gouernement of things to the hands of his mother Emma, and of Goodwine that was erle of Kent. He leuied a sore tribute of his subiects here in England to pay the souldiers and 

<note place="marg">Altribute raised. <emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 mariners of his nauie, as first 21 thousand pounds, *entity* 99 pounds, and afterward vnto 32 ships there was a paiment made of a 11 thousand and 48 pounds. To euerie mariner of his nauie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun. Wil. Malm. Matth. West. Sim. Dun.</emph></note>

 he caused a paiment of 8 marks to be made, and to euerie master 12 mark About the paiment of this monie great grudge grew amongst the people, insomuch that two of his seruants, which were appointed collectors in the citie of Worcester, the one named Feader, and the other Turstane, were there slaine. In reuenge of which contempt a great part of the countrie with the citie was burnt, and the goods of the citizens put to the spoile by such power of lords and men of warre as the king had sent against them.</p>
<p>Shortlie after, Edward king Hardicnutes brother came foorth of Normandie to visit him and his mother qu*entity*ene Emma, of whome he was most ioifullie and honorablie welcomed and interteined, and shortlie after made returne backe againe. It should appeare by some writers, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matt. West. Ran. Higd. Marianus.</emph></note>

 that after his comming ouer out of Normandie he remained still in the realme, so that he was not in Normandie when his halfe brother Hardicnute died, but here in England: although other make other report, as after shall b*entity*e shewed. Also (as before ye haue heard) 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 some writers seeme to meane, that the elder brother Alfred came ouer at the same time. But suerlie they are therein deceiued: for it was knowne well inough how tenderlie king Hardicnute loued his brethren by the mothers side, so that there was not anie of the lords in his daies, that durst attempt anie such iniurie against them. True it is, that as well earle Goodwine, 

<note place="marg">The bishop of Worcester accused for making away of Alfred.</note>

 as the bishop of Worcester (that was also put in blame and suspected for the apprehending and making away of Alfred,.as before ye haue heard) were charged by Hardicnute as culpable in that matter, insomuch that the said bishop was expelled out of his see by Hardicnute: and after twelue moneths space was restored, by meanes of such summes of monie as he gaue by waie of amends.</p>
<p>Earle Goodwine was also put to his purgation, by taking an oth that he was not guiltie. 

<note place="marg">Earle Googwin excuseth himselfe. The gift which earle Goodwin gaue to the king.</note>

 Which oth was the better allowed, by reason of such a present as he gaue to the king for thered*entity*eming of his fauour and good will, that is to say, a ship with a sterne of gold, conteining therein 80 souldiers, wearing on each of their armes two bracelets of gold of 16 ounces weight, a triple habergion guilt on their bodies, with guilt burgenets on their heads, a swoord with guilt hilts girded to their wastes, a battell-axe after the maner of the Danes on their left shoulder, a target with bosses and mails guilt in their left hand, a dart in their right hand: and thus to conclude, they were furnished at all points with armor and weapon accordinglie. It hath b*entity*ene said, that earle Goodwine minded to marie his daughter to one of these brethren, and perceiuing 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 that the elder brother Alfred would disdaine to haue hir, thought good to dispatch him, that the other taking hir to wife, h*entity*e might be next heire to the crowne, and so at length inioy it, as afterwards came to passe.</p>
<p>Also about that time, when the linage of the kings of England was in maner extinct, the English people were much carefull (as hath b*entity*ene said) about the succession of those that should inioie the crowne. Wherevpon as one Brightwold a moonke of Glastenburie, that was afterward bishop of Wincester, or (as some haue written) of Worcester, studied oftentimes thereon: it chanced that he dreamed one night as he slept in his bed, that he saw saint Peter consecrate *entity* annoint Edward the sonne of Egelred (as then remaining in exile in Normandie) king of England. And as he thought, he did demand of saint Peter, who should succ*entity*ed the said Edward? Wherevnto answer was made by the apostle; Haue thou no care for such matters, for the kingdome of England is Gods kingdome. Which suerlie in good <pb n="738"/>earnest may appeare by manie great arguments to be full true vnto such as shall well consider the state of this realme from time to time, how there hath b*entity*ene euer gouernours raised vp to mainteine the maiestie of the kingdome, and to reduce the same to the former dignitie, when by anie infortunate mishap it hath beene brought in danger.</p>

<note place="marg">The death of K. Hardicnute. <emph>Sam. Dunel. Matth. West.</emph></note>

<p>But to returne now to king Hardicnute, after he had reigned two y*entity*ers lacking 10 daies, as he sat at the table in a great feast holden at Lambeth, he fell downe suddenlie with the pot in his hand, and so died not without some suspicion of poison. This chanced on the 8 of Iune at 

<note place="marg"><date>1042.</date></note>

 Lambeth aforesaid, where, on the same day a mariage was solemnized betw*entity*ene the ladie Githa, the daughter of a noble man called Osgot Clappa, and a Danish lord also called Canute 

<note place="marg">K. Hardicnute his conditions and liberalitie in housekeeping. <emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 Prudan. His bodie was buried at Winchester besides his father. He was of nature verie curteous, gentle and liberall, speciallie in keeping good ch*entity*ere in his house, so that he would haue his table couered foure times a day, *entity* furnished with great plentie of meates and drinks, wishing that his seruants and all strangers that came to his palace, might rather leaue than 

<note place="marg">Of whom the Englishmen learned excessiue f*entity*eding.</note>

 want. It hath b*entity*ene commonlie told, that Englishmen learned of him their excessiue gourmandizing *entity* vnmeasurable filling of their panches with meates and drinkes, whereby they forgat the vertuous vse of sobrietie, so much necessarie to all estates and degr*entity*es, so profitable for all common-wealthes, and so commendable both in the sight of God, and all good men.</p>

<note place="marg">The end of the Danish rulers.</note>

<p>In this Hardicnute ceased the rule of the Danes within this land, with the persecution which they had executed against the English nation, for the space of 250 yeres *entity* more, that is to say, euer since the tenth yeere of Brithrike the king of Westsaxons, at what time they first began to inuade the English coasts. Howbeit (after others) they should s*entity*eme to haue ruled here but 207, reckoning from their bringing in by the Welshmen in despite of the Saxons, at which time they first began to inhabit here, which was 835 of Christ, 387 after the comming of the Saxons, and 35 n*entity*ere complet of the reigne of Egbert.</p>
<p>*entity* But to let this p*entity*ece of curiositie passe, this land felt that they had a time of arriuall, a time of inuading, a time of ouerrunning, and a time of ouerruling the inhabitants of this maine continent. Wherof manifest proofes are at this day remaining in sundrie places, sundrie ruines I meane and wastes committed by them; vpon the which whensoeuer a man of a relenting spirit casteth his eie, he can not but enter into a dolefull consideration of former miseries, and lamenting the defacements of this Ile by the crueltie of the bloudthirstie enimie, cannot but wish (if he haue but "Minimam misericordiae guttam quae maior est spatioso oceano," as one saith) and earnestlie desire in his heart that the like may neuer light vpon this land, but may be auerted and turned away from all christian kingdomes, through his mercie, whose wrath by sinne being set on fire, is like a consuming flame; and the swoord of whose vengeance being sharpened with the whetstone of mens wickednesse, shall hew them in p*entity*eces as wood for the fornace.</p>

<p>IMMEDIATLIE vpon the deth of Hardiknought, and before his corps was committed to 

<note place="marg">EDWARD. <emph>Hen. Hunt.</emph></note>

 buriall, his halfe brother Edward, sonne of king Egelred begotten of qu*entity*ene Emma, was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor</emph></note>

 chosen to be K. of England, by the generall consent of all the nobles and commons of the realme. Therevpon were ambassadours sent with all sp*entity*ed into Normandie, to signifie vnto him his election, and to bring him from thence into England in deliuering pledges for more assurance, that no fraud nor deceit was ment of the Englishmen, but that vpon his comming thither, he should receiue the crowne without all contradiction. Edward then aided by his coosine William duke of Normandie, tooke the sea, *entity* with a small companie of Normans came 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt. Wil. Malm.</emph> The third of Aprill.</note>

 into England, where he was receiued with great ioy as king of the realme, *entity* immediatlie after was crowned at Winchester by Edsinus then archbishop of Canturburie, on Easter day in the yeare of our Lord 1043, which fell also about the fourth yeare of the emperour Henrie 

<note place="marg"><date>1043.</date></note>

 the third, surnamed Niger, in the 12 yeare of Henrie the first of that name king of France, and about the third yeare of Macbeth king of Scotland.</p>
<p>This Edward the third of that name before the conquest, was of nature more m*entity*eke and simple than apt for the gouernement of the realme, *entity* therefore did earle Goodwine not onelie s*entity*eke the destruction of his elder brother Alfred, but holpe all that he might to aduance this Edward to the crowne, in hope to beare great rule in the realme vnder him, whome he knew to be soft, gentle, and easie to be persuaded. But whatsoeuer writers doo report hereof, sure it is, that Edward was the elder brother, and not Alfred: so that if earle Goodwine did shew <pb n="740"/>his furtherance by his pretended cloake of offering his friendship vnto Alfred to betraie him, he did it by king Harolds commandement, and yet it may be that he meant to haue vsurped the crowne to him selfe, if each point had answered his expectation in the sequele of things, as he hoped they would; and therfore had not passed if both the brethren had b*entity*ene in heauen. But yet when the world framed contrarie (peraduenture) to his purpose, he did his best to aduance Edward, trusting to beare no small rule vnder him, being knowen to be a man more appliable to be gouerned by other than to trust to his owne wit: and so chieflie by the assistance of earle Goodwine (whose authoritie, as appeareth, was not small within the realme of England in those daies) Edward came to atteine the crowne: wherevnto the earle of Chester Leofrike also shewed all the furtherance that in him laie.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd. ex Mariano. Alb. Crantz.</emph></note>

<p>Some write (which seemeth also to be confirmed by the Danish chronicles) that king Hardiknought in his life time had receiued this Edward into his court, and reteined him still in the sane in most honorable wise. But for that it may appeare in the abstract of the Danish chronicles, what their writers had of this matter recorded, we doo here passe ouer, referring those that be desirous to know the diuersitie of our writers and theirs, vnto the same chronicles, where they may find it more at large expressed. This in no wise is to be left vnremembred, that 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> Danes expelled.</note>

 immediatlie after the death of Hardiknought, it was not onelie decreed *entity* agreed vpon by the great lords *entity* nobles of the realme, that no Dane from thenceforth should reigne ouer them, but also all men of warre and souldiers of the Danes, which laie within anie citie or castell in garrison within the realme of England, were then expelled and put out or rather slaine (as the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 Danish writers doo rehearse.) Amongst other that were banished, the ladie Gonild neece to 

<note place="marg">Gonill n*entity*ece to K. Swaine.</note>

 king Swaine by his sister, was one, being as then a widow, and with hir two of hir sonnes, which she had then liuing; Heming and Turkill were also caused to auoid. Some write that Alfred the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 brother of king Edward, came not into the realme till after the death of Hardiknought, and that he did helpe to expell the Danes, which being doon, he was slaine by earle Goodwine and other of his complices. But how this may stand, considering the circumstances of the time, with such things as are written by diuers authors hereof, it may well be doubted. Neuerthelesse, whether earle Goodwine was guiltie to the death of Alfred, either at this time, or before, certeine it is, that he so cleared himselfe of that crime vnto king Edward the brother of Alfred, that 

<note place="marg">K. Edward marieth the daughter of earle Goodwine.</note>

 there was none so highlie in fauour with him as earle Goodwine was, insomuch that king Edward maried the ladie Editha, the daughter of earle Goodwine, begotten of his wife Thira that was sister to king Hardiknought, and not of his second wife, as some haue written. Howbeit, king Edward neuer had to doo with hir in fleshlie wise. But whether he absteined because 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 he had happilie vowed chastitie, either of impotencie of nature, or for a priuie hate that 

<note place="marg">K. Edward absteineth from the companie of his wife.</note>

 he bare to hir kin, men doubted. For it was thought, that he est*entity*emed not earle Goodwine so greatlie in his heart, as he outwardlie made shew to doo, but rather for feare of his puissance dissembled with him, least he should otherwise put him selfe in danger both of losse of life and kingdome.</p>
<p>Howsoeuer it was, he vsed his counsell in ordering of things concerning the state of the 

<note place="marg">K. Edward dealeth strietlie with his mother qu*entity*ene Emma.</note>

 common wealth, and namelie in the hard handling of his mother queene Emma, against whome diuers accusations were brought and alledged: as first, for that she consented to marie with K. Cnute, the publike enimie of the realme: againe, for that she did nothing aid or 

<note place="marg">Qu*entity*ene Emma despoiled of hir goods. She is accused of dissolute liuing. <emph>Ren. Higd.</emph> She purgeth hir selfe by the law Ordalium.</note>

 succour hir sons while they liued in exile, but that woorse was, contriued to make them away; for which cause she was despoiled of all hir goods. And because she was defamed to be naught of hir bodie with Alwine or Adwine bishop of Winchester, both she and the same bishop were committed to prison within the citie of Winchester (as some write.) Howbeit others affirme, that she was strictlie kept in the abbie of Warwell, till by way of purging hir selfe, after a maruellous manner, in passing barefooted ouer certeine hot shares or ploughirons, according to the law <emph>Ordalium,</emph> she cleared hir selfe (as the world tooke it) and was restored to hir first estate and dignitie.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

<p>Hir excessiue couetousnesse, without regard had to the poore, caused hir also to be euill reported of. Againe, for that she euer shewed hir selfe to be more naturall to the issue which <pb n="741"/>she had by hir second husband Cnute, than to hir children which she had by hir first husband king Egelred (as it were declaring how she was affected toward the fathers, by the loue borne to the children) she lost a great p*entity*ece of good will at the hands of hir sonnes Alfred and Edward: so that now the said Edward inioieng the realme, was easilie induced to thinke euill of hir, and therevpon vsed hir the more vncurteouslie. But hir great liberalitie imploied on the church of Winchester, which she furnished with maruellous rich iewels and ornaments, wan hir great commendation in the world, and excused hir partlie in the sight of manie, of the infamie imputed to hir for the immoderate filling of hir coffers by all waies and meanes she could deuise. Now when she had purged hir selfe, as before is mentioned, hir sonne king Edward had hir euer after in great honor and reuerence. And whereas Robert archbishop of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd,</emph></note>

 Canturburie had b*entity*ene sore against hir, he was so much abashed now at the matter, that he fled into Normandie, where he was borne. But it should s*entity*eme by that which after shal be said in the next chapter, that he fled not the realme for this matter, but bicause he counselled the king to banish earle Goodwine, and also to vse the Englishmen more strictlie than reason was he should.</p>

<note place="marg">Robert archbishop of Can turburie. Frenchmen or Normans first entered into England.</note>

 time of his banishment had shewed him great friendship, wherefore he now sought to recompense them. Amongst other, the forenamed Robert of Canturburie was one, who before his comming ouer was a moonke in the abbeie of Gemeticum in Normandie, and being by the king first aduanced to gouerne the s*entity*e of London, was after made archbishop of Canturburie, and bare great rule vnder the king, so that he could not auoid the enuie of diuerse noble men, and speciallie of earle Goodwine, as shall app*entity*ere. About the third y*entity*ere of king Edwards reigne, Osgot Clappa was banished the realme. And in the y*entity*ere following, that is to

<p>About this time Swaine the sonne of earle Goodwine was banished the land, and fled into

<p>In the meane time, about the sixt y*entity*ere of king Edwards reigne, certeine pirats of the Danes arriued in Sandwich hauen, and entring the land, wasted and spoiled all about the coast. There be that write, that the Danes had at that time to their leaders two capteins,

 the one named Lother, and the other Irling. After they had b*entity*ene at Sandwich, and brought from thence great riches of gold and siluer, they coasted about vnto the side of Essex, and there spoiling the countrie, went backe to the sea, and sailing into Flanders, made sale of their spoiles and booties there, and so returned to their countries. After this, during the reigne of king Edward, there chanced no warres, neither forren nor ciuill, but that the same was either with small slaughter luckilie ended, or else without anie notable aduenture changed 

<note place="marg">Rise *entity* Griffin Princes of Wales.</note>

 into peace. The Welshmen in d*entity*ed with their princes Rise and Griffin wrought some trouble, but still they were subdued, and in the end both the said Rise and Griffin were brought vnto confusion: although in the meane time they did much hurt, and namelie Griffin, who with aid of some Irishmen, with whome he was alied, about this time entred into the Seuerne sea, and tooke preies about the riuer of Wie: and after returned without anie battell to him offered.</p>

<p>About the same time, to wit, in the y*entity*ere 1049, the emperor Henrie the third made warres

But at Canturburie one of his herbingers, dealing roughlie with one of the citizens about a lodging, which he sought to haue rather by force than by intreatance, occasioned his owne death. Whereof when the erle was aduertised, he hasted thither to reuenge the slaughter of his seruant, and slue both that citizen which had killed his man, and eight*entity*ene others.</p>

<p>The citizens h*entity*erewith in a great furie, got them to armor, and set vpon the earle and his retinue, of whom they slue twentie persons out of hand, *entity* wounded a great number of the residue, so that the earle scarse might escape with one or two of his men from the fraie, *entity* with all sp*entity*ed returned backe to the king, presenting gr*entity*euous information against them of Canturburie, for their cruell vsing of him, not onlie in sleaing of his seruants, but also in putting him in danger of his life. The king crediting the earle, was higlie offended against the citizens, and with all speed sending for earle Goodwine, declared vnto him in greeuous wise, the rebellious act of them of Canturburie, which were vnder his iurisdiction.</p>

<pb n="743"/>
<p>The earle who was a man of a bold courage and quicke wit, did perceiue that the matter was made a great deale woorse at the first in the beginning, than of likelihood it would prooue in the end, thought it reason therefore that first the answere of the Kentishmen should be heard, before anie sentence were giuen against them. H*entity*erevpon, although the king commanded him foorthwith to go with an armie into Kent, and to punish them of Canturburie in most rigorous maner, yet he would not be too hastie, but refused to execute the kings commandement, both for that he bare a p*entity*ece of grudge in his mind, that the king should 

<note place="marg">Earle Goodwine offended with the king for fauouring strangers.</note>

 fauour strangers so highlie as he did; and againe, bicause h*entity*ereby he should s*entity*eme to doo pleasure to his countriemen, in taking vpon him to defend their cause against the rough accusations of such as had accused them. Wherefore he declared to the king that it should be conuenient to haue the supposed offendors first called afore him, and if they were able to excuse themselues, then to be suffered to depart without further vexation: and if they were found faultie, then to be put to their fine, both as well in satisfieng the king, whose peace they had broken, as also the earle, whom they had indamaged.</p>
<p>Earle Goodwine departed thus from the king, leauing him in a great furie: howbeit he passed litle thereof, supposing it would not long continue. But the king called a great assemblie 

<note place="marg">A councel called at Glocester. Siward earle of Northumberland, Leofrike earle of Chester, Rafe earle of Hereford. <emph>Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 of his lords togither at Glocester, that the matter might be more d*entity*epelie considered. Siward earle of Northumberland, and Leofrike earle of Chester, with Rafe earle of Hereford, the kings nephue by his sister Goda, and all other the noble men of the realme, onlie earle Goodwine and his sonnes ment not to come there, except they might bring with them a great power of armed men, and so remained at Beuerstane, with such bands as they had leauied, vnder a colour to resist the Welshmen, whome they bruted abroad to be readie to inuade the marches about Hereford. But the Welshmen preuenting that slander, signified to the king that no such matter was ment on their parties, but that earle Goodwine and his sonnes with their complices went about to mooue a commotion against him. H*entity*erevpon a rumor was raised in the court, that the kings power should shortlie march foorth to assaile earle Goodwine in that place where he was lodged. Wherevpon the same earle prepared himselfe, and sent to his friends, willing to sticke to this quarrell, and if the king should go about to force them, then to withstand him, rather than to y*entity*eld and suffer themselues to be troden vnder foot by strangers. Goodwine in this meane time had got togither a great 

<note place="marg">Earle Goodwine meaneth to defend himselfe against the king Swaine. <emph>Ran. Higd. Matth. West. Simon Dun.</emph> Harold. <emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 power of his countries of Kent, Southerie, and other of the west parts. Swaine likewise had assembled much people out of his countries of Barkeshire, Oxfordshire, Summersetshire, Herefordshire, and Glocestershire. And Harold was also come to them with a great multitude, which he had leuied in Essex, Norffolke, Suffold, Cambridgeshire, *entity* Huntingtonshire.</p>
<p>On the other part, the earles that were with the king, Leofrike, Siward, and Rafe, raised all the power which they might make, and the same approching to Glocester, the king thought himselfe in more suertie than before, in so much that whereas earle Goodwine (who lay with his armie at Langton there not farre off in Glocestershire) had sent vnto the king, requiring that the earle of Bullongne, with the other Frenchmen and also the Normans which held the castell of Douer, might be deliuered vnto him. The king, though at the first he stood in great doubt what to doo, yet hearing now that an armie of his friends was comming, made answere to the messingers which Goodwine had sent, that he would not deliuer a man of those whome Goodwine required, and h*entity*erewith the said messengers being departed, the kings armie entered into Glocester, and such readie good wils app*entity*ered in them all to fight with the aduersaries, that if the king would haue permitted, they would foorthwith haue gone out and giuen battell to the enimies.</p>
<p>Thus the matter was at point to haue put the realme in hazard not onelie of a field, but of vtter ruine that might thereof haue insued: for what on the one part and the other, there were assembled the chiefest lords and most able personages of the land. But by the wisedome and good aduise of earle Leofrike and others, the matter was pacified for a time, and order taken, that they should come to a parlement or communication at London, vpon <pb n="744"/>pledges giuen and recemed as well on the one part as the other. The king with a mightie armie of the Northumbers, and them of Mercia, came vnto London, and earle Goodwine with his sonnes, and a great power of the Westsaxons, came into Southwarke, but perceiuing that manie of his companie stale awaie and slipt from him, he durst not abide anie longer to enter talke with the king, as it was couenanted, but in the night next insuing fled awaie with all sp*entity*ed possible.</p>

<p>Some write, how an order was prescribed that Swanus the eldest sonne of Goodwine should depart the land as a banished man to qualifie the kings wrath, and that Goodwine and one other of his sons, that is to say, Harold should come to an other assemblie to be holden at London, accompanied with 12 seruants onelie, *entity* to resigne all his force of knights, gentlemen and souldiers vnto the kings guiding and gouernment. But when this last article pleased nothing earle Goodwine, and that he perceiued how his force began to decline, so as he should not be able to match the kings power, he fled the realme, and so likewise did

 Ireland, entered into the Seuerne sea, landing on the coasts of Summersetshire and Dorsetshire, where falling to spoile, they were incountred by a power assembled out of the counties of Deuonshire and Summersetshire: but Harold put his aduersaries to flight, and slue thirtie gentlemen of honor, or thanes (as they called them) with a great number of others. Then Harold and his brethren, returning with their preie and bootie to their ships, and coasting about the point of Cornwall, came and ioined with their father *entity* their other brethren, then soiorning in the Ile of Wight.</p>
<p>King Edward to withstand their malice, had rigged and furnished foorth sixtie ships of warre, with the which he himselfe went to the water, not sticking to lie aboord at that season, 

<note place="marg"><emph>Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 although he had appointed for capteines and admerals two earles that were his coosins, Odo and Rafe, who had charge of the whole armie. Rafe was his nephue, as sonne to his sister Goda by hir first husband Gualter de Maunt. But although they were knowne to be sufficient men for the ordering of such businesse, yet he thought the necessitie to be such, as his person could not be presentlie spared. Therefore he was diligent in fores*entity*eing of things by good aduise, although age would not giue him leaue to execute the same by his owne hand and force of bodie. But as the nauies on both parts were readie to haue ioined, they were seuered by reason of a thicke mist that then rose, wherby their furious rage was restreined for that time: and immediatlie therevpon, Goodwine and his complices were forced by a contrarie wind, to returne to the places from whence they came. Shortlie after by mediation of friends, a peace was made, and earle Goodwine restored home, and obteined againe both the kings fauour, and all his former liuings: for he was such an eloquent *entity* wise man, that he clered and purged himselfe of all such crimes and accusations, as in anie sort had b*entity*ene laid against him. Thus haue some written concerning this agr*entity*ement betwixt king Edward and erle Goodwine, where other make somewhat larger report thereof, as thus.</p>
<p>At the same time that the two sonnes of erle Goodwine Harold and Leofwine came foorth of Ireland, and inuaded the west countrie, king Edward rigged foorth fortie ships, the which throughlie furnished with men, munition, and vittels, he sent vnto Sandwich, commanding the capteines there to wait for the comming of erle Goodwine, whom he vnderstood to be in a readinesse to returne into England: but notwithstanding, there wanted no diligence in them to looke to their charge, erle Goodwine secretlie with a few ships which he had got togither, ariued in Kent; and sending foorth his letters and messengers abroad to the citizens of Canturburie, to them of Sussex, Southerie, *entity* others, required aid of them, who with one consent promised to liue and die with him.</p>
<p>The capteines of the nauie at Sandwich aduertised hereof, made towards the place where they thought to haue found earle Goodwine: but he being warned of their comming, escaped by flight, and got him out of their danger, wherevpon they withdrew to Sandwich, and after returned to London. Earle Goodwine aduertised thereof, sailed to the Ile of Wight, and wafted vp and downe those seas, till his sonnes Harold and Leofwine came and ioined their nauie with his, and ceassing from spoile, onlie sought to recouer vittels to serue their turne. And incresing their power by such aid as they might any where procure, at <pb n="746"/>length they came to Sandwich, wherof king Edward hauing knowledge, being then at London, 

<note place="marg">It s*entity*emeth that earle Goodwine was well friended.</note>

 he sent abroad to raise all the power he might make. But they that were appointed to come vnto him, lingred time, in which meane while earle a Goodwine comming into the Thames, *entity* so vp the riuer, arriued in Southwarke, on the day of the exaltation of the crosse in September, being monday, and their staieng for the tide, solicited the Londoners, so that he obteined of them what he could desire.</p>
<p>Afterwards, without disturbance, he passed vp the riuer with the tide through the south arch of the bridge, *entity* at the same instant, a mightie armie which he had by land, mustered in the fields on that south side the same riuer, and herewith his nauie made towards the north side of the riuer, as if hey ment to inclose the kings nauie, for the king had also a nauie *entity* an armie by land: but yet sith there were few either on the one part or the other, that were able to doo anie great feat except Englishmen, they were loth to fight one against another, wherevpon the wiser sort on both sides sought meanes to make an atonement: and so at length by their diligent trauell, the matter was taken vp, and the armies being dismissed on both parts, earle Goodwine was restored to his former dignitie. Herevpon were pledges deliuered on his behalfe, that is to say, Wilnotus one of his sonnes, and Hacun the sonne of Swanus the eldest sonne of Goodwine. These two pledges were sent vnto William duke of Normandie, to be kept with him for more assurance of Goodwines loialtie.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd. Matth. West. Simon Dun. Wil Malm.</emph></note>

<p>Some write that Swanus the eldest sonne of Goodwine was not reconciled to the kings fauour at this time; but whether he was or not, this is reported of him for a truth, that after he had attempted sundrie rebellions against king Edward, he lastlie also rebelled against his father Goodwine, and his brother Harold, and became a pirate, dishonouring with such manifold robberies as he made on the seas, the noble progenie whereof he was descended. Finallie vpon remorse of conscience (as hath b*entity*ene thought) for murthering of his coosine (or as some say his brother) erle Bearne, he went on pilgrimage to Hierusalem, and died by the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ran. Higd. Will. Malms.</emph></note>

 way of cold which he caught in returning homeward (as some write) in Licia: but others affirme, that he fell into the hands of Saracens that were robbers by the high waies, and so was murthered of them.</p>

<p>THE foresaide William duke of Normandie (that after conquered this land) during the time of Goodwines outlawrie, came ouer into this land with a faire retinue of men, and was ioifullie receiued of the king, and had great ch*entity*ere. Now after he had taried a season, he returned into his countrie, not without great gifts of iewels and other things, which the king <pb n="747"/>most liberallie bestowed vpon him. And (as some write) the king promised him at that

 time, to make him his heire to the realme of England, if he chanced to die without issue. *entity* Shortlie after, or rather somewhat before, queene Emma the kings mother died, and was buried at Winchester.</p>
<p>After that earle Goodwine was restored to the kings fauour, bicause he knew that Robert the archbishop of Canturburie had beene the ch*entity*efe procurer of, the kings euill will towards him, he found means to weare him out of credit, and diuers other specially of the Normans, bearing the world in hand, that they had sought to trouble the state of the realme, *entity* to set variance betwixt the king and the lords of the English nation: whereas the Normans againe alledged, that earle Goodwine and his sonnes abused the kings soft and gentle nature, *entity* would not sticke to ieast and mocke at his curteous and mild proc*entity*edings. But howsoeuer the matter went, archbishop Robert was glad to depart out of the realme, and going to 

<note place="marg">The archbishop of Canturburie banished.</note>

 Rome, made complaint in the court there, of the iniuries that were offred him: but in returning through Normandie, he died in the abbeie of Gemmeticum, where he had bene moonke before his comming into England.</p>
<p>Diuerse others were compelled to forsake the realme at the same time, both spirituall men and temporall, as William bishop of London, and Vlfe bishop of Lincolne. Osberne 

<note place="marg">Normans banished the relame.</note>

 named Pentecost, and his companion Hugh, were constreined to surrender their castels, and by licence of earle Leofrike withdrew thorough his countrie into Scotland, where, of king Mackbeth they were honorablie receiued. These were Normans: for (as partlie ye haue heard) king Edward brought with him no small number of that nation, when he came from thence to receiue the crowne, and by them he was altogither ruled, to the great offending of his owne naturall subiects the Englishmen, namelie earle Goodwine and his sonnes, who in those daies for their great possessions and large reuenues, were had in no small reputation with the English people.</p>
<p>After that Robert the archbishop of Canturburie was departed the realme, as before ye haue heard, Stigand was made archbishop of Canturburie, or rather thrust himselfe into 

<note place="marg">Stigand archbishop of Canturburie.</note>

 that dignitie, not being lawfullie called, in like manner as he had doone at Winchester: for whereas he was first bishop of Shireborne, he left that church, and tooke vpon him the bishoprike of Winchester by force, and now atteining to be archbishop of Canturburie, he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ranul. Hig. Fabian.</emph> Stigand infamed of simonie.</note>

 kept both Winchester and Canturburie in his hand at one instant. This Stigand was greatlie infamed for his couetous practises in sale of possessions apperteining to the church. He was nothing learned: but that want was a common fault amongest the bishops of that age, for it was openlie spoken in those daies, that he was m*entity*et onelie to be a bishop, which 

<note place="marg">What maner of men m*entity*et to be bishops in those daies.</note>

 could vse the pompe of the world, voluptuous pleasures, rich raiment, and set himselfe foorth with a iollie retinue of gentlemen and seruants on horsse-backe, for therein stood the countenance of a bishop, as the world then went; and not in studie how to haue the people fed with the word of life, to the sauing of their soules.</p>
<p>King Edward now in the twelfth yeare of his reigne, hauing brought the state of the realme 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 quite from troubles of warre both by sea and land, began to fores*entity*e as well for the welth of his subiects, as for himselfe, being naturallie inclined to wish well to all men. He therefore considered, how by the manifold lawes which had beene made by Britaines, Englishmen and Danes within this land, occasion was ministred to manie, which measured all things by respect of their owne priuate gaine and profit, to peruert iustice, and to vse wrongfull dealing in stead of right, clouding the same vnder some branch of the lawe naughtilie misconstrued. Wherevpon to auoid that mischiefe, he picked out a summe of that huge and vnmesurable masse and heape of lawes, such as were thought most indifferent and necessarie, *entity* therewith ordeined a few, *entity* those most wholesome, to be from thenceforth vsed; according to whose prescript, men might liue in due forme and rightfull order of a ciuill life. These lawes were afterwards called the common lawes, and also saint Edward his 

<note place="marg">The lawes of S. Edward instituted.</note>

 lawes; so much esteemed of the Englishmen, that after the conquest, when the Normans oftentimes went about to abrogate the same, there chanced no small mutinies and rebellions <pb n="748"/>for reteining of those lawes. But heere is to be noted, that although they were called saint Edwards lawes, they were for the more part made by king Edgar; but now by king Edward restored, after they had bin abrogated for a time by the Danes.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>1053.</date></note>

<p>About this time, earle Goodwine died suddenlie (as some haue recorded) as he sat at table 

<note place="marg"><date>or 1054.</date></note>

 with the king: and vpon talke ministred of the death of Alfred the kings brother, to excuse himselfe, he tooke a peece of bread, and did eate it, saieng; God let me neuer swallow 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hector Boet. Polydor. Will Malmes. Malth. West. Ran. Higd. ex Mariano. Simon Dun.</emph> This is the likesiest tale.</note>

 this bread downe into my chest, but that I may presentlie be choked therewith, if euer I was weetting or consenting vnto Alfreds death! and immediatlie therewith he fell downe starke dead. Other say, that he ended his life at Winchester, where being suddenlie surprised with sicknesse, as he sat at the table with the king vpon an Easter monday; yet he liued till the Thursday following, and then died. His earledome was giuen vnto his sonne Harold; and Harolds earledome, which was Oxford, was giuen vnto Algar the sonne of Leofrike.</p>
<p>This Goodwine, as he was a man of great power, wise, hardie, and politike; so was he ambitious, desirous to beare rule, and loth that anie other person should passe him in authoritie. But yet, whether all be true that writers report of his malicious practises to bring himselfe and his sonnes to the chiefe seat of gouernement in the kingdome, or that of hatred such slanders were raised of him, it may of some perhaps be doubted; because that in the daies of king Edward (which was a soft and gentle prince) he bare great rule and authoritie, and so might procure to himselfe euill report for euerie thing that chanced amisse: as oftentimes it commeth to passe in such cases, where those that haue great dooings in the gouernement of the common wealth, are commonlie euill spoken of, and that now and then without their guilt. But truth it is, that Goodwine being in authoritie both in the daies of king Edward and his predecessors, did manie things (as should appeare by writers) more 

<note place="marg">Hen. Hunt.</note>

 by will than by law, and so likewise did his sonnes; vpon presumption of the great puissance that they and their father were of within the realme.</p>
<p>He had to wife Editha, the sister of king Cnute, of whome he begat thr*entity*e sonnes (as 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polyder.</emph></note>

 some write) that is to say, Harold, Biorne, *entity* Tostie: also his daughter Editha, whome he found meanes to bestow in mariage vpon K. Edward, as before ye haue heard. But other 

<note place="marg"><emph>Will, Malm.</emph></note>

She vsed to buy great numbers of yoong persons, and namelie maids that were of anie excellent beautie and personage, whome she sent ouer into Denmarke, and there sold them to hir most aduantage. After hir deceasse (as the same authors record) Goodwine maried another woman, by whome he had issue six sonnes, Swanus or Swaine, Harrold, Tostie or Tosto, Wilnot, Girth, and Leofrike; of whom further mention is *entity* shall be made, as places conuenient shall serue thereto.</p>

<p>It is recorded also, that in the foresaid battell, in which earle Siward vanquished the Scots, one of Siwards sonnes chanced to be slaine, whereof although the father had good cause to be sorowfull, yet when he heard that he died of a wound which he had receiued in fighting stoutlie in the forepart of his bodie, and that with his face towards the enimie, he greatlie reioised thereat, to heare that he died so manfullie. But here is to be noted, that not now, but a little before (as Henrie Hunt. saith) that earle Siward went into Scotland himselfe in person, he sent his sonne with an armie to conquere the land, whose hap was there to be slaine: and when his father heard the newes, he demanded whether he receiued the wound whereof he died, in the forepart of the bodie, or in the hinder part: and when it was told him that he receiued in the forepart; "I reioise (saith he) euen with all my heart, for I would not wish either to my sonne nor to my selfe any other kind of death."</p>
<p>Shortlie after, Aldred the bishop of Worcester was sent vnto the emperour Henrie the 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 third, to fetch Edward the sonne of Edmund Ironside into England, whome king Edward 

<note place="marg"><date>1057.</date></note>

 was desirous to s*entity*e, meaning to ordeine him heire apparant to the crowne: but he died the same yeare after he came into England. This Edward was surnamed the outlaw: his bodie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt.</emph></note>

 was buried at Winchester, or (as an other saith) in the church of S. Pauls in London.</p>

<note place="marg"><date>1055.</date></note>

<p>*entity* About the same time K. Edward by euill counsell (I wot not vpon what occasion, but as it is thought without cause) banished Algar the sonne of earle Leofrike: wherevpon he got him into Ireland, and there prouiding 18 ships of rouers, returned, *entity* landing in Wales, ioined himselfe with Griffin the king or prince of Wales, and did much hurt on the borders about Hereford, of which place Rafe was then earle, that was sonne vnto Goda the sister of K. Edward by hir first husband Gualter de Maunt. This earle assembling an armie, came 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 forth to giue battell to the enimies, appointing the Englishmen contrarie to their manner to fight on horssebacke, but being readie (on the two *entity* twentith of October) to giue the onset in a place not past two miles from Hereford, he with his Frenchmen and Normans fled, and 

<note place="marg">The Welshmen obteine the victorie against Englishmen and Normans.</note>

 so the rest were discomfited, whome the aduersaries pursued, and slue to the number of 500, beside such as were hurt and escaped with life. Griffin and Algar hauing obteined this victorie, entered into the towne of Hereford, set the minster on fire, slue seuen of the canons that stood to defend the doores or gates of the principall church, and finallie spoiled and burned the towne miserablie.</p>
<p>The king aduertised hereof, gathered an armie, ouer the which Harold the sonne of earle Goodwine was made generall, who followed vpon the enimies that fled before him into Northwales, *entity* staied not, till hauing passed through Stratcluid, he came to the mountaines 

<note place="marg">Stratcluid.</note>

 of Snowdon, where he pitched his field. The enimies durst not abide him, but got them 

<note place="marg">Snowdon.</note>

 into Southwales, whereof Harold being aduertised, left the more part of his armie in North. wales to resist the enimies there, *entity* with the residue of his people came backe vnto Hereford, recouered the towne, and caused a great and mightie trench to be cast round about it, 

<note place="marg">The citie of Hereford fortified by Harold.</note>

 with an high rampire, and fensed it with gates and other fortifications. After this, he did so much, that comming to a communication with Griffin and Algar at a place called Biligelhage, a peace was concluded, and so the nauie of earle Algar sailed about, and came to <pb n="750"/>Chester, there to remaine, till the men of warre and marriners had their wages, while he went to the king, who pardoned his offense, *entity* restored him to his earledome.</p>

 at his manor of Bosham, went aboord one day into his fishers boat or craier, and caused the same to lanch forth to the sea for his pleasure: but by misfortune at the same time, a contrarie wind suddenlie came about, and droue the vessell on land into France vpon the coast of Ponthieu, where he was taken by the countrie people, *entity* presented to the earle of Ponthieu named Guie or Guido, who kept him as prisoner, meaning to put him to a grieuous ransome. But Harold remembring himselfe of a wile, dispatched a messenger forth with all sp*entity*ed vnto William. duke of Normandie, signifieng vnto him, that he being sent from king Edward to confirme such articles, as other meane men that had b*entity*ene sent vnto him afore had talked of, by chance he was fallen into the hands of the earle of Ponthieu, and kept as prisoner against all order of law, reason, or humanitie. Duke William thus informed by the messenger, sent to the earle of Ponthieu, requiring him to set earle Harold at libertie, that he might repaire to him according to his commission. The earle of Ponthieu at the

<p>There be that agr*entity*e partlie with this report, and partlie varie: for they write, that earle Harold tooke the sea vpon purpose to haue sailed into Flanders, and that by force of wind he was driuen to the coast of Ponthieu, and so after came into Normandie in maner as before is mentioned.

Earle Harold behaued himselfe so, that he shewed good proofe both of his wisedome and policie, and also of his forwardnesse to execute that with hand, which by wit he had deuised, so that duke William had him in high fauour, and (as it hath b*entity*ene said) earle Harold (to procure him more friendship at the dukes hands) declared vnto him, that king Edward had ordeined him his heire if he died without issue, and that he would not faile to k*entity*epe the realme of England to the dukes vse, according to that ordinance, if K.

But God of his mercie turne that euill hap from this realme, or at the least, if it be his pleasure, that it must needs come to passe, yet to staie it till after my daies!"

But rather it maie be thought, that king Edward had made no such promise at all, but perceiued the ambitious desire of duke William, and therefore would not that anie occasion should be ministred unto him to take hold of.

 fell variance betwixt the two brethren, earle Harold and earle Tostie at Windsor, where the court then lay, in so much that earle Harold caught Tostie by the haire of the head in the kings presence, and stroke him. Heervpon, Tostie departing from the court in great anger, came to Hereford in the marches of Wales, where Harolds seruants were preparing for the kings comming to their maisters house, which seruants he tooke and slue, chopping them in p*entity*eces, and threw into this hogshead of wine a leg, into that barrell of sider an arme, into this vessell of ale an head: and so into the lomes of meth and tubs of brine and other liquor he bestowed the parts of the dead carcasses of his brothers seruants, sending the king woord that he had prouided at his brothers manor, against his coming, good plentie of sowse *entity* powdred meat, whatsoeuer he should find beside.</p>
<p>The rumor of this cruell deed sprang ouer all the realme, wherevpon the Northumbers, whome he had gouerned for the space of ten y*entity*eres verie cruellie, tooke occasion to rebell against him, and slue his seruants both Englishmen and Danes, spoiled his houses, and tooke

 awaie his horsses, his armour, and all other his goods and houshold stuffe. The chiefest cause (as is remembred by some writers) that mooued the Northumbers thus to rise and rebell against Tostie, was for the detestable murther of certeine gentlemen of their countrie, seruants unto Gospatrike, whom the queene in behalfe of hir brother had caused to be slaine in the court by treason, in the fourth night of Christmas last past, and also in reuenge of other noble men, which in the last y*entity*ere Tostie himselfe had commanded to be murthered in his owne chamber at Yorke, whither he had allured them to come vnder colour of concluding a peace with them. Also the gr*entity*euous paiments, wherewith he charged the people of that countrie, set them in a great rage against him.</p>
<p>But the king aduertised h*entity*ereof, liked not their dooings, for that they had doone it without commandement or commission, and therefore sent earle Harold with an armie to chastise them, but they were strong inough to withstand him, as those which were assembled in

Howbeit to haue the kings peace, they offered to returne home, so that they might haue an other earle appointed them, for that they plainlie protested, that they being freemen, borne and bred out of bondage, might not suffer anie cruell gouernor to rule ouer them, being taught by their ancestors, either to liue in libertie, or to die in defense thereof. If therefore it might please the king to assigne Marcharus the son of earle Algar to be their ruler, he should see how obedient subiects they would prooue *entity* shew themselues to be, when they should be vsed after a reasonable and courteous manner.

 Edward was a prince of such a vertuous disposition of mind, that his fame of holinesse sprang ouer all. He abhorred warres and shedding of bloud, in so much that when he liued as a banished man in Normandie, he had this saieng oftentimes in his mouth, that he had rather liued priuate life for euer, than to obteine the kingdome by the slaughter and death of anie men. He could not abide to haue the people oppressed with tributes or exactions, <unclear> </unclear> so much that he caused the paiement called Danegilt (which had continued for the space almost of fortie y*entity*eres) to ceasse. It hath beene said, that when the collectors of this <unclear> menor</unclear> some other subsidie, had got an huge quantitie of treasure togither, they <pb n="754"/>

<note place="marg">A dluell fetching gambols.</note>

 brought it vnto him, and laid it altogither vpon an heape, so to delight his eies: but he declaring that he saw a dluell plaieng and fetching gambols about that heape of monie, commanded that it should be had awaie, and restored againe to them of whome it was leauied.</p>
<p>In diet and apparell he was spare and nothing sumptuous: and although on high feasts he ware rich apparell, as became the maiestie of his roiall personage: yet he shewed no proud nor loftie countenance, rather praising God for his bountifull goodnesse towards him extended, than est*entity*eming heerein the vaine pompe of the world. The pleasure that he tooke chieflie in this world for the refreshing of his wits, consisted onelie in hawking and hunting, which exercises he dailie vsed, after he had first beene in the church at diuine seruice. In other things he seemed wholie giuen to a deuout trade of life, charitable to the poore, and verie liberall, namelie to hospitals and houses of religion in the parties of beyond the sea, wishing euer that the moonks and religious persons of his realme would haue followed the vertue and holinesse of life vsed amongst them of forren parties. As hath b*entity*ene thought he was inspired with the gift of prophesie, and also to haue had the gift of healing infirmities and diseases. He vsed to helpe those that were vexed with the disease, commonlie called the kings euill, and left that vertue as it were a portion of inheritance vnto his successors the kings of this realme.</p>

<note place="marg">A tale of a ring.</note>

<p>He was warned (as hath b*entity*ene reported) of his death certeine daies before he died, by a ring that was brought him by certeine pilgrims comming from Hierusalem, which ring he had secretlie giuen to a poore man that asked his charitie in the name of God and saint Iohn 

<note place="marg">King Edward canonized for a saint. <emph>Wil. Malms. Matt. Westm.</emph></note>

 the Euangelist. But to conclude, such was the opinion conceiued of his holinesse of life, that shortlie after his decease, he was canonized amongst the number of saints, and named Edward the Confessof. Whilest he lay sicke of that sicknesse, whereof at length he died, after he had remained for two daies speechlesse, the third day after when he had laine for a time in a slumber or soft sl*entity*epe, at the time of his waking, he fetched a d*entity*epe sigh, and thus said; "Oh Lord God almightie, if this be not a vaine fantasticall illusion, but a true vision which I haue s*entity*ene, grant me space to vtter the same vnto these that stand h*entity*ere present, or else not." And herewith hauing his speech perfect, he declared how he had s*entity*ene two moonks stand by him as he thought, whome in his youth he knew in Normandie to haue liued godlie, and died christianlie. "These moonks (said he) protesting to me that they were the messengers of God, spake these words; Bicause the ch*entity*efe gouernors of England, the bishops and abbats, are not the ministers of God, but the diuels, the almightie God hath deliuered this kingdome for one y*entity*ere and a day into the hands of the enimie, and wicked spirits shall walke abroad through the whole land. And when I made answer that T would declare these things to the people, and promised on their behalfe, that they should doo penance in following the example, of the Niniuites: they said againe, that it would not be, for neither should the people repent, nor God take anie pitie vpon them. And when is there hope to haue an end of these miseries said I? Then said they; When a grene tr*entity*e is cut in sunder in the middle, and the part cut off is caried thr*entity*e acres bredth from the stocke, and returning againe to the stoale, shall ioine therewith, and begin to bud *entity* beare fruit after the former maner, by reason of the sap renewing the accustomed nourishment; then (I say) may there be hope that such euils shall ceasse and diminish." *entity* With which words of the king, though some other that stood by were brought in feare, yet archbishop Stigand made but a ieast thereof, saieng, that the old man raued now in his sickenesse, as men of great y*entity*eres vse to doo. Neuerthelesse the truth of this prophesie afterwards too plainlie appeared, when England became the habitation of new strangers, in such wise, that there was neither gouernor, bishop, nor abbat remaining therein of the English nation. But now to make an end with king Edward, he was of person comelie, *entity* of an indifferent stature, of white haire, both head and beard, of face ruddie, and in all parts of his bodie faire skinned, with due state and proportion of lims as was thereto conuenient. In the y*entity*ere before the death of king Edward, a blasing starre appeared, the which when a moonke of Malmesburie named Eilmer beheld, he vttered these words (as it were by way of prophesieng:) <pb n="755"/>Thou art come (saith he) thou art come, much to be lamented of manie a mother: it is long agone sith I saw th*entity*e, but now I doo behold thee the more terrible, threatening destruction to this countrie by thy dreadfull appearance. In the person of king Edward ceased by his death the noble progenie of the Westsaxon kings, which had continued from the first yeare of the reigne of Cerdike or Cerdicius, the space of 547 yeeres complet. And from Egbert 266 y*entity*eres.</p>

By other it should s*entity*eme, that Woden had but fiue sonnes: as Vecta, great grandfather to Hengist; Wepedeg, ancestor to the kings of the Eastangles; Viclac, from whome proceeded the kings of Mercia; Saxuad, from whom the kings of Essex came; and Beldag, of whose generation proceeded the kings of the Southsaxons, Westsaxons, and the Northumbers.

 *entity* perplexitie to whome they might best commit the roiall gouernement of the realme. <pb n="756"/>

<note place="marg">1065, after the account of the church of England. <emph>Matth. West. Polydor.</emph> Edeling, that is, a noble man, and such one as is come of the kings bloud.</note>

 For there was not anie among them that had iust title thereto, or able and apt to take the charge vpon him. For although Edgar surnamed Edeling, the sonne of Edward the outlaw, that was sonne of Edmund Ironside, was at the same time latelie come into England, with his mother and sisters out of Hungarie where he was borne: yet for that he was a child, *entity* not of sufficient age to beare rule, they durst not as then commit the gouernement of the realme vnto him, least (as some haue thought) his tendernesse of age might first br*entity*ed a contempt of his person, and therewith minister occasion to ciuill discord, wherby a shipwracke of the estate might ensue, to the great annoie and present ouerthrow of such as then liued in the, same. But what consideration soeuer they had in this behalfe, they ought not to haue defrauded the yoong gentleman of his lawfull right to the crowne. For as we haue heard and s*entity*ene, God, whose prouidence and mightie power is shewed by ouerthrowing of high and mightie things now and then, by the weake and f*entity*eble hath gouerned states and kingdomes oftentimes in as good quiet and princelie policie by a child, as by men of age and great discretion.</p>
<p>But to the purpose, beside the doubt which rested among the lords, how to bestow the crowne, the manifold and strange woonders, which were s*entity*ene and heard in those daies, betokening (as men thought) some change to be at hand in the state of the realme, made the lords afraid, and namelie bicause they stood in great doubt of William duke of Normandie, who pretended a right to the crowne, as lawfull heire appointed by king Edward, for that 

<note place="marg">Dukes of Normandie.</note>

 he was kin to him in the second and third degree. For Richard the first of that name duke of Normandie, begot Richard the second, and Emma; which Emma bare Edward by hir husband Ethelred. Richard the second had also issue Richard the third, and Robert, which Robert by a concubine had issue William, surnamed the bastard, that was now duke of Normandie, and after the death of his coosine king Edward, made claime (as is said) to the crowne of England.</p>
<p>Whilest the lords were thus studieng and consulting what should be best for them to doo 

<note place="marg">Harold proclaimed king of England.</note>

 in these doubts, Harold, the son of Goodwine earle of Kent, proclaimed himselfe king of England: the people being not much offended therewith, bicause of the great confidence and opinion which they had latelie conceiued of his valiancie. Some write (among whome 

<note place="marg"><emph>Edmerus.</emph></note>

 Edmerus is one) how king Edward ordeined before his death, that Harold should succ*entity*ed him as heire to the crowne and that therevpon the lords immediatlie after the said Edwards deceasse, crowned Harold for their king, and so he was consecrated by Aldred archbishop of Yorke, according to the custom and maner of the former kings, or (as other affirme) he 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 set the crowne on his owne head without anie the accustomed ceremonies, in the y*entity*ere after the birth of our sauiour 1066, or in the y*entity*ere of Christ 1065. after the account of the church of England (as before is noted.)</p>
<p>But how and whensoeuer he came to the seat roiall of this kingdome, certeine it is, that this Harold in the begining of his reigne, considering with himselfe how and in what sort he had taken vpon him the rule of the kingdome, rather by intrusion than by anie lawfull 

<note place="marg">Harold s*entity*eketh to win the peoples hearts. <emph>Sim. Dunel.</emph></note>

 right, studied by all meanes which way to win the peoples fauour, and omitted, no occasion whereby he might shew anie token of bountious liberalitie, gentlenesse and courteous behauiour towards them. The gr*entity*euous customes also and taxes which his predecessors had raised, he either abolished or diminished: the ordinarie wages of his seruants and men of warre he increased, and further shewed himselfe verie well bent to all vertue and goodnesse, whereby he purchased no small fauor among such as were his subiects.</p>

<note place="marg">An ambassage from Normandie.</note>

<p>Whilest Harold went about thus to steale the peoples good willes, there came ouer vnlooked for sundrie ambassadours from William the bastard duke of Normandie, with commission to require him to remember his oth sometime made to the said William in the time of his extremitie, which was, that he the said Harold should aid him in the obteining of the crowne of England, if king Edward should happen to die without issue. This couenant he made (as it is supposed) in king Edwards daies, when (by licence of the same Edward, or rather (as Edmerus writeth) against his will) he went ouer into Normandie to visit his brethren, which laie there as pledges.</p>

<pb n="757"/>
<p>Howbeit at this present, Harolds answer to the said ambassadors was, that he would be 

<note place="marg">K. Harolds answer.</note>

 readie to gratifie the duke in all that he could demand, so that he would not aske the realme, which alreadie he had in his full possession. And further he declared vnto them (as some 

<note place="marg"><emph>Edmerus.</emph></note>

 write) that as for the oth which he had made in times past vnto duke William, the same was but a constreined *entity* no voluntarie oth, which in law is nothing since thereby he tooke vpon 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 him to grant that which was not in his power to giue, he being but a subiect whilest king Edward was liuing. For if a promised vow or oth which a maid maketh concerning the bestowing of hir bodie in hir fathers house, without his consent is made void; much more an oth by him made that was a subiect, and vnder the rule of a king, without his souereignes consent, ought to be void and of no value. He alledged moreouer, that as for him to take an oth to deliuer the inheritance of anie realme without the generall consent of the estates of the same, could not be other than a great p*entity*ece of presumption, yea although he might haue iust title therevnto; so it was an vnreasonable request of the duke at this present to will him to renounce the kingdome, the gouernance whereof he had alreadie taken vpon him, with so great fauor and good liking of all men.</p>
<p>Duke William hauing receiued this answer, and nothing liking thereof, sent once againe 

<note place="marg">Duke william eftsoones sendeth to king Harold.</note>

 to Harold, requiring him then at the least-wise, that he would take his daughter to wife, according to his former promise in refusing whereof he could make no sound allegation, bicause it was a thing of his owne motion, and in his absolute power, both to grant and to performe. But Harold being of a stout courage, with proud countenance frowned vpon the Norman ambassadors, and declared to them that his mind was nothing bent as then to y*entity*eld therevnto in any maner of wise. And so with other talke tending to the like effect he sent them away without anie further answer; The daughter of duke William whome Harold should haue maried, was named Adeliza, as Gemeticensis. saith, and with hir (as the same 

<note place="marg"><emph>Gemeticensis.</emph></note>

 author writeth) it was couenanted by duke William, that Harold should inioy halfe the realme in name of hir dower. Howbeit some write that this daughter of duke William. was 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 departed this life before the comming of these ambassadors, and that Harold therevpon thought himselfe discharged of the oth and couenants made to duke William, and therefore sent them away with such an vntoward answer.</p>
<p>But howsoeuer it was, after the departure of these ambassadors, king Harold (doubting 

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph></note>

 what would insue) caused his ships to be newlie rigged, his men of warre to be mustered, md sp*entity*edidlie put in a readinesse, to the end that if anie sudden inuasion should be made and attempted by his enimie, he might be able to resist them. *entity* About the same time also, and vpon the 24 of Aprill (whilest Harold was making prouision to withsand the Norman force) there appeared a blasing starre, which was s*entity*ene not onelie here in England, but also in other parts of the world, and continued the space of seuen daies.

For Tostie the brother of king Harold (who in the daies of king Edward for his crueltie had b*entity*ene chased out of the realme by the Northumbers) returning out of Flanders, assembled a nauie of ships from diuers parts to the number of 60, with the which he arriued in the Ile of Wight, *entity* there spoiled the countrie, and afterward sailing about by the coasts of Kent, he tooke sundrie preies their also, and came at the last to Sandwich: so that Harold was now constreined to appoint the nauie which he had prepared against the Normans, to go against his brother earle Tostie. Whereof the said Tostie being aduertised, drew towards Lindsey in Lincolnshire, and there taking land did much hurt

<p>This trouble was scarse quieted, but streightwaies another came in the necke thereof, farre more dangerous than the first. For Tostie, perceiuing that he could get no aid in Scotland

 and that the said Harold Harfager with all conuenient sp*entity*ed passed foorth, *entity* with a nauie of 300 saile entered into the riuer of Tine, where after he had rested a few daies to refresh his people, earle Tostie came also with his power (according to an appointment which should be

 Northumbers, which was led by the earls Edwine and Marchar (two brethren) and there discomfited and chased them into the citie, with great slaughter and bloudshed.</p>
<p>Harold king of England being aduertised of this chance, made the more hast forward (for he was alreadie in the field with his armie, intending also to come towards his enimies) so that vpon the fift day after he came to Stamford bridge, finding there the said king Harfager and Tostie readie imbattelled, he first assailed those that kept the bridge, where (as some writers affirme)

The French king also did as much for his part as laie in him to helpe forwards this so high an enterprise. Wherefore when all things were now in a readinesse, he came to the towne of S.

<p>Wherein we haue to note, that whether it were for displeasure that the pope had sometime conceiued for the wrong doone to the archbishop, or at the onlie sute of duke William, certeine it is that the pope, as then named Alexander the second, fauored this enterprise of the duke, and in token thereof sent him a white banner, which he willed him to set vp in the decke of the ship, wherein he himselfe should saile.

<p>NOW it fortuned that both armies, as well the kings as the earles, being prepared to 

<note place="marg"><emph>Will. Malmes</emph></note>

 battell, diuerse offers were made on each side (before they fell to the conflict) for an vnitie to haue b*entity*ene had betwixt the two princes: but when no conditions of agreement could take place, they forthwith prepared themselues to trie the matter by dint of swoord. And so on the 14 day of October, being saturday, both hosts met in the field, at a place in Sussex not farre from Hastings, whereas the abbeie of Battell was afterward builded. The Englishmen 

<note place="marg">The order of the Englishmen.</note>

 were all brought into one entire maine batell on foot, with huge axes in their hands, and paled a front with paueises, in such wise that it was thought vnpossible for the enimie to breake 

<note place="marg"><emph>Matth. West.</emph></note>

 their arraie. On the other side, the Normans were diuided into seuerall battels, as first the footmen that were archers, and also those that bare gleiues and axes were placed in the forefront, 

<note place="marg">The arraie of the Normans.</note>

 front and the horssemen diuided into wings stood on the sides in verie good order.</p>
<p>All the night before the battell, the Englishmen made great noise and slept not, but sang 

<note place="marg"><emph>Hen. Hunt. Will. Malmes.</emph></note>

 and fell to drinking and making of reuell *entity* pastime, as though there had beene no account to be made of the next daies trauell. But the Normans behaued themselues warilie and soberlie, <pb n="762"/>  spending all that night in praier and confessing their sinnes vnto God; and in the morning earelie they receiued the communion before they went foorth to the battell. Some write, that when duke William should put on his armour to go to the field, the backe halfe of his curasses by chance was set on before by such as holpe to arme him: at which chance he tooke occasion of laughter, saieng merrilie to them that stood by; "No force, this is good lucke, for the estate of my dukedome shall be yer night changed into a kingdome." Beside this, he spake manie comfortable woords vnto his men, to incourage them to the battell. Neither was Harold foretfull in that point on his part. And so at conuenient time when both armies were readie, they made forward each to incounter with other, on the foresaid fouret*entity*enth day of October, with great force and assurance.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Polydor.</emph> The battell betwixt king Harold and duke William is begun.</note>

<p>In the beginning of the battell, the arrowes flue abroad freshlie on both sides, till they came to ioine at hand strokes, and then preassed each side vpon his counter part with swoords, axes, and other hand weapons verie egerlie. Duke William commanded his horssemen to giue the charge on the breasts of his enimies battels: but the Englishmen k*entity*eping themselues close togither without scattering, receiued their enimies vpon the points of their weapons with such fiercenesse and in such stiffe order, that manie of the Norman horssemen were ouerthrowne without recouerie, and slaine at the first brunt. When duke William perceiued this inconuenience (as he that well and throughlie vnderstood the skilfull points of warre as well as the best) he gaue a signe to his men (according to an order appointed before hand vpon anie 

<note place="marg">The policie of duke William to disorder his enimies. <emph>H. Hunt. Wil. Malm.</emph></note>

 such occasion) that they should giue backe, and make a countenance as though they did fl*entity*e, which was quicklie doone by the Normans, and withall they imbattelled their footmen in a new order, so that their horssemen shifted themselues on the wings, readie to rescue the footmen if their arraie should happen to be disturbed.</p>
<p>By this wilie stratagem and policie of warre, the Englishmen were deceiued: for they beholding the Normans somwhat shrinking backe to bring themselues into the aboue said order, thought verelie that they had fled, and therevpon meaning to pursue them before they should recouer their ground, they brake their arraie, and began to follow the chase: wherevpon the Normans (perceiuing now that all things came to passe as they desired) sp*entity*edilie returned, and casting themselues togither quicklie into arraie, began to charge them againe afresh, and so 

<note place="marg">A sore foughten battell. King Harold slaine.</note>

 hauing them at that aduantage, they slue them downe on euerie side. The Englishmen on the other part fought sore, and though their king was beaten downe among them and slaine, yet were they loth to fl*entity*e or giue ouer; so sharpe was the battell, that duke William himselfe had thr*entity*e horsses slaine vnder him that day, and not without great danger of his person.</p>

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Matth. West.</emph></note>

<p>Some of the Englishmen got them to the height of an hill, and beate backe the Normans that forced themselues to win the hill of them, so that it was long yer the Normans could preuaile, being oftentimes driuen downe into the botome of the vallie beneath. At length the 

<note place="marg">The Englishmen put to flight.</note>

 Englishmen, perceiuing themselues to be ouermatched and beaten downe on euerie side, and therevnto greatlie discouraged with slaughter of their king, began first to giun ground, and after to scatter and to run away, so that well was he that might then escape by fight. When 

<note place="marg"><emph>Chron. de bello. Wil. Geme.</emph> The Normans fall into a ditch.</note>

 they had fought the most part of all that saturday, the Normans followed the chase with such eger rashnesse, that a great number of them falling with their horsses and armour into a blind ditch (shadowed with reed and sedges which grew therein) were smouldered and pressed to death, yer they could be succoured or get anie reliefe. The next day the Normans fell to gathering in the spoile of the field, burieng also the dead bodies of their people that were slaine at the battell, giuing licence in semblable manner to the Englishmen to doo the like. 

<note place="marg"><emph>Giral. Camb.</emph></note>

 Of the death of Harold diuerse report diuerslie, in so much that Girald Cambrensis saith, that after king Harold had receiued manie wounds, and lost his left eie, he fled from the field vnto the citie of Westchester, and liued there long after, an holie life, as an anchoret in the cell of S. James, fast by S. Johns church, and there made a godlie end. But the saieng of 

<note place="marg"><emph>Wil. Malm. Hen. Hunt. Matth. West.</emph></note>

 Giraid Cambren. in that point is not to be credited, bicause of the vnlikelihood of the thing it selfe, and also generall consent of other writers, who affirme vniuersallie that he was killed in the battell, first being striken thorough the left eie by the scull into the braine with an arrow, wherevpon falling from his horsse to the ground, he was slaine in that place, after he had <pb n="763"/>reigned nine moneths and nine daies, as Floniacensis dooth report. He was a man of a comelie 

<note place="marg"><emph>Floriac. Simon Dun.</emph></note>

 lie stature, and of a hawtie courage, *entity* albeit that for his valiancie he was highlie renowmed and honored of all men, yet through his pride and ambition he lost the harts of manie. There 

<note place="marg"><emph>Henr. Hunt. Polydor.</emph> The chronicles of Normandie haue of English men slaine 67974, and of Normans 6013.</note>

 were slaine in this battell, besides king Harold and his two brethren, Girth and Leofrike, what on the one side and on the other, aboue twentie thousand men.</p>
<p>The bodie of king Harold being found among other slaine in the field, was buried at Waltham, within the moasterie of the holie crosse which he before had founded, and indowed to the behoofe of such canons as he had placed there, with faire possessions. Verelie (as some old writers haue reported) there was nothing in this man to be in anie wise dispraised, if his 

<note place="marg"><emph>Ex</emph> 6. <emph>libro Polycraticon, siue de nugis curiclium. Iohn Sarish.</emph></note>

 ambitious mind could haue beene staied from coueting the kingdome, and that he could haue b*entity*ene contented to haue liued as a subiect. Among other manifest proofes of his high valiancie, this is remembred of him, that being sent against the Welshmen (as before is partlie mentioned) knowing their readie nimblenesse in seruice, and how with their light armed men they were accustomed to annoie and distresse those that should assaile them, he likewise (to match them) prepared light armed men for the purpose, *entity* so being furnished with such bands of nimble men and light souldiers, entered vpon the mounteins of Snowdon, and there remained amongst the enimies for the space of two y*entity*eres. He sore afflicted the Welsh nation, tooke their kings, and sent their heads vnto the king that sent him about his businesse, and proceeding in such rigorous maner as might mooue the hearers to lament and pitie the case, he caused all the male kind that might be met with, to be miserablie slaine: and so with the edge of his swoord he brought the countrie to quiet, and withall made this lawe; that if anie Welshman from thencefoorth should presume to passe the limits ouer Offas ditch with anie weapon about him, he should lose his right hand. To conclude, by the valiant conduct of this chieftaine, the Welshmen were then so sore brought vnder, that in maner the whole nation might s*entity*eme to faile, and to be almost vtterlie destroied. And therefore by permission of the king of England, the women of Wales ioined themselues in marriage with Englishmen. Finallie, h*entity*ereby the bloud of the Saxons ceassed to reigne in England after they had continued possession of the same, from the first comming of Hengist, which was about the y*entity*ere of our Sauiour 450, or 449, vntill that present yeere of king Harolds death, which chanced in the 

<note place="marg">1069.</note>

 y*entity*ere 1069, So that from the beginning of Hengist his reigne, vnto Harolds death, are reckoned 916 y*entity*eres, or (after some) 617, as by the supputation of the time will easilie appeere. By all the which time there reigned kings of the Saxons bloud within this land, except that for the space of twentie y*entity*eres and somewhat more, the Danes had the dominion of the realme in their possession: for there are reckoned from the beginning of K. Swaines reigne (which was the first Dane that gouerned England) vnto the last y*entity*ere of K. Hardicnute (the last Dane that ruled heere) 28 y*entity*eres, in which meane space Egelred recouering the kingdome reigned 2 y*entity*eres, then after him his sonne Edmund Ironside continued in the rule one y*entity*ere; so that the Danes had the whole possession of the land but 25 y*entity*eres in all. Touching this alteration, and others incident to this Hand, read a short aduertisement annexed (by waie of conclusion) to this historie, comprising a short summarie of the most notable conquests of this countrie one after an other, by distances of times successiuelie.</p>

<head type="unitnum">The Twelfe Chapter.</head>
<p>NOW, forsomuch as it pleased God by his hid and secret iudgement so to dispose the realme of England, and in such wise, as that the gouernance thereof should fall after this maner <pb n="764"/>into the hands of Willianm duke of Normandie, I haue thought good before I enter further into this historie (being now come to the conquest of the realme, made by the for esaid duke of Normandie) to set downe his pedegr*entity*e, thereby to shew how he descended from the first duke of that countrie, who was named Rollo, and after by receiuing baptisme called Robert.</p>
<p>The said Rollo or Rou, was sonne to a great lord in Denmarke called Guion, who hauing two sons, the said Rou and Gourin, and being appointed to depart the countrie, as the lots fell to him and other (according to the maner there vsed, in time when their people were increased to a greater number than the countrie was able to susteine) refused to obeie that order, and made warre there against the king, who yet in the end by practise found meanes to slea the foresaid Guion, and his sonne Gourin; so that Rou or Rollo, hauing thus lost his father and brother, was compelled to forsake the countrie, with all those that had holpe his father to make warre against the king. Thus driuen to s*entity*eke aduentures, at length he became a christian, and was created duke of Normandie, by gift of Charles king of France, surnamed le Simple, whose daughter the ladie Gilla he also maried: but she departing this life without issue, he maried Pop*entity*e daughter to the earle of Bessin and Baileux, whome he had kept as his wife before he was baptised, and had by hir a sonne named William Longesp*entity*e, and a daughter named Gerlota.</p>
<p>William Longesp*entity*e or Longaspata, had to wife the ladie Sporta, daughter to Hubert earle of Senlis, by whome he had issue Richard the second of that name duke of Normandie, who married the ladie Agnes, the daughter of Hugh le grand, earle of Paris, of whome no issue proc*entity*eded: but after hir deceasse, he maried to his second wife a gentlewoman named Gonnor, daughter to a knight of the Danish line, by whom he had thr*entity*e sonnes, Richard that was 

<note place="marg">Ye must note that there was one Richard duke of Normandie before Rollo.</note>

 after duke of Normandie, the third of that name, Robert and Mauger. He had also by hir three daughters, Agnes otherwise called Emma, married first to Egelred king of England, and after to K. Cnute: Helloie, otherwise Alix, bestowed vpon Geffrey earle of Britaine: and Mawd coupled in marriage with Euldes earle of Charters and Blais. Richard the third of that name maried Iudith, sister to Geffrey earle of Britaine, by whome he had issue thr*entity*e sonnes, Richard, Robert, and William, and as manie daughters: Alix, married to Reignold earle of Burgogne, Elenor married to Baldwine earle of Flanders; and the third died yoong, being affianced to Alfonse king of Nauarre. Their mother deceassed after she had beene married ten y*entity*eres, and then duke Richard married secondlie the ladie Estric, sister to Cnute king of England and Denmarke, from whome he purchased to be diuorsed, and then married a gentlewoman called Pauie, by whome he had issue two sonnes, William earle of Arques, and Mauger archbishop of Rouen.</p>
<p>Richard the fourth of that name, duke of Normandie, eldest sonne to Richard the third, died without issue, and then his brother Robert succ*entity*eded in the estate, which Robert begat vpon Arlete or Harleuina daughter to a burgesse of Felais, William surnamed the bastard, afterward duke of Normandie, and by conquest king of England. Of whose father duke Robert, *entity* his paramour Arlete, take this pleasant remembrance for a refection after the perusing of the former sad and sober discourses. </p>

Let your grace pardon me." He liked hir answer: and so and so foorth for that time.</p>
<p>This duke before his voiage, calling at Fiscam all his nobilitie vnto him, caused them to

 sweare fealtie vnto his yoong sonne William, whome he then at his iournie betooke vnto the gouernance of earle Gilbert, and the defense of the gouernour vnto Henrie the French king. So Robert passing foorth in his pilgrimage, shewed in euerie place and in all points a magnanimitie

Whereby not manie y*entity*eres after, as Gilbert the gouernour, by Rafe the childes coosine germane, was slaine; the dukedome anon, by murther and fighting among themselues was sore troubled in all parts.

The Foresaid Historie, Wherin The Foure Great And Notable Conquests Of
This Land Are Brieflie Touched, Being A Conchlusion Introductorie, As
Is Said In The Argument.</head>

<note place="marg">Britaine inhabited by Brute.</note>
<p>IN the former part of this historie it is manifest to the heedful reader, that (after the opinion of most writers) Brute did first inhabit this land, and called it then after his owne name, 


 Britaine, in the y*entity*ere after the creation of the world 2855, and in the y*entity*ere before the incarnation of Christ 1108. 

<note place="marg">1 Britaine conquered by the Romans.</note>

*entity* Furthermore the said land of Britaine was conquered by C. Iulius Cesar, and made tributarie to the Romans in the 50 y*entity*ere before the natiuitie of Christ, and 


 so continued 483 y*entity*eres. So that the Britains reigned without tribute and vnder tribute, from Brute, vntill the fourth yeere of the reigne of king Cadwalladar, which was in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 686. And so the Britains had continuance of the gouernement of this land the space of 1794 y*entity*eres. Then was the realme of Britaine an heptarchie, that is, diuided into seuen kingdoms. And Britaine receiued the faith of Christ in the 7 y*entity*ere of the reigne of king Lucius, which was in the 187 y*entity*ere after the birth of Christ. 

<note place="marg">2 Britaine conquered and ouercome by the Saxons.</note>
*entity* Next after the Britains entered the Saxons, in the third y*entity*ere of king Vortiger; and in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 450, 
 and they gouerned vntill the last y*entity*ere of king Athelstane, which was in the y*entity*ere of Christ 938. So that the time of the Saxons first entrance into this realme, and the time of their regiment was the space of 487 y*entity*eres. 

<note place="marg">3 Britaine conquered and ouercome by the Danes.</note>

*entity* Howbeit, in the time of their gouernement, that is to say, in the 9 y*entity*ere of king Britricus, which was in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 387, the Danes entred into this land, spoiling and persecuting the people therin most gr*entity*euouslie. At the 
last, Sweno or Swaine the Dane obteined possession roiall, in the y*entity*ere of Grace 1012, whose time of regiment lasted about three y*entity*eres. After whom his sonne Canutus succeeded, and reigned 19 y*entity*eres. After him Harold his sonne, who ruled thr*entity*e yeeres: and after him Hardicnute the sonne of Canutus, whose gouernement continued but thr*entity*e yeeres. This Hardicnute was the last king of the Danes, at which time the Danes were expelled and hunted out of the realme, which was in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 1042. So that it may appeare by this collection, that the Danes ruled as kings in this land by the space of 28 y*entity*eres. Hereby also it is euident, that from the time of the first entrance of the Danes into this realme, vntill their last <pb n="766"/>
 expulsion *entity* riddance was 255 y*entity*eres. 

<note place="marg">4 Britaine conquered and possessed by the Normans.</note>

*entity* Finallie the Normans entred this land likewise, and conquered the same as before is expressed, in the y*entity*ere of our Lord 1067, which is since, vntill this present y*entity*ere of our Lord 1585, drawing n*entity*ere to the number of 600 and od y*entity*eres.</p>

<p>Now let these alterations of regiments be remembred [touching the which read a notable animaduersion in the description of Britaine, pag. 49,50,51] and teach vs that therein the iudgements of God reuealed themselues to speciall purposes. And whatsoeuer hath b*entity*ene mentioned before either concerning the subuersion of people, the desolation of prouinces, the ouerthrow of nobles, the ruine of princes, and other lamentable accidents diuerslie happening vpon sundrie occasions let vs (I say) as manie as will reape fruit by the reading of chroncles, imagine the matters which were so manie y*entity*eres past to be present, and applie the profit and commoditie of the same vnto our selues: knowing (as one wisely said) <quote lang="la">Post sacram paginam chronica viuum veritatis typum gerere,</quote> that next vnto the holie scripture, chronicles doo carie credit.
