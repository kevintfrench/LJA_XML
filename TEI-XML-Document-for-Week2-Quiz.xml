                        <l>What do you want for your Happy New Year?</l>
                        <l>People of every age and state</l>
                        <l>Have somewhat they fain would ask of Fate;</l>
                        <l>If you had but a slave of the lamp or the ring,</l>
                        <l>And could rub him up instantly, what should he bring?</l>
                        <l>Whatever it be, if we can but guess it,</l>
                        <l>We'll wish from our hearts that you each may possess it.</l>
                        <l>We'll wish for the Queen that her boys and her girls</l>
                        <l>May be bright as diamonds and fair as pearls;</l>

                        <l>That the sky of her life be bright above her,</l>
                        <l>And her days be long with the lieges that love her.</l>
                        <l>We'll wish that the Lords may pass good laws,</l>
                        <l>And the Commons be strong in each righteous cause;</l>
                        <l>That army and navy alike may be</l>
                        <l>The best of defences by land and sea;</l>

                        <l>That those who hunger in body or soul</l>

                        <l>And a harvest reaped from the sower's seed.</l>
                        <l>We'll wish to the sickly the toughest of lives,</l>
                        <l>To maidens, husbandsâto bachelors, wivesâ</l>
                        <l>That babes may increase in strength and grace,</l>

                        <l>And the purse that lacks find a store of gold,</l>
                        <l>And the hand that has it a will to spend,</l>
                        <l>And the heart that loveth not, grace to mend.</l>
                        <l>We'll wish for workers of each degree</l>
                        <l>To earn and eat in prosperity;</l>
                        <l>Plenty of coals at the poor man's door,</l>
                        <l>Plenty of grain on the farmer's floor,</l>
                        <l>Plenty of fees to the learned professions,</l>
                        <l>Plenty of railways through landed possessions,</l>
                        <l>Plenty of cargoes brought home on the breeze</l>
                        <l>By the quickest of ships on the calmest of seas,</l>
                        <l>Unpacked at the docks to the merchant's content,</l>
                        <l>And sold in the market at fifty per cent.</l>
                        <l>And we wish, O dear reader, all jesting apart,</l>
                        <l>That mercy and love may grow strong in your heart,</l>
                        <l>That dearer than riches, or what they can buy,</l>
                        <l>Be the creed which shall help you to live or to die.</l>

                    <lg type="verse_paragraph">
                        <l><hi>TIS</hi> April! 'Tis a holyday! and they shut close yester-even</l>
                        <l>The golden gates of Sydenham with the clang of iron bars;</l>
                        <l>The terraces lie shadowless beneath the smile of Heaven,</l>
                        <l>And trodden but by chasing clouds, and the silent feet of stars.</l>
                        <l>'Tis April! 'Tis a holyday! and the halls of the Museum</l>
                        <l>Have nothing noisier than the ghosts of Pharaohs on their floors;</l>
                        <l>The mastodons and elephants feel very dull to see them,</l>
                        <pb n="35" id="VAB7022-038"/>
                        <l>And stare with idle eyeballs at the unresponsive doors.</l>
                        <l>But the river still is open, and its gentle tide comes flowing</l>
                        <l>With a thousand tender whispers of the everlasting sea;</l>
                        <l>And I know that in the woodlands all the early flowers are blowing,</l>
                        <l>And breathing out sweet messages to Laurence and to me.</l>
                        <l>The sun is mounting towards the noon, and up above the towers</l>
                        <l>Of the Abbey and the Parliament the sky's without a flaw.</l>
                        <l>A most disloyal thing it were to disobey the flowers,</l>
                        <l>So, Laurence, get your Sunday-hat, and clear your brains of law.</l>
                        <l>I dearly love this London, this royal northern London,</l>
                        <pb n="36" id="VAB7022-039"/>
                        <l>And am up in all its history, to Brutus and to Lud;</l>
                        <l>But I wish that certain Puritan simplicities were undone,</l>
                        <l>That the houses had more gable-ends, and the river less of mud.</l>
                        <l>And often, as I wander in the fine new squares, I ponder</l>
                        <l>The reason why men like to live in long white plastered rows,</l>
                        <l>And sigh for our old streets, like those across the Channel yonder,</l>
                        <l>At Bruges or at Antwerp, such as everybody knows.</l>
                        <l>But our river still is beautiful, rejoicing in the quaintest</l>
                        <l>Old corners for a painter (till the new quays are begun).</l>
                        <l>See there the line of distant hills, and where the blue is faintest,</l>
                        <pb n="37" id="VAB7022-040"/>
                        <l>The brown sails of the barges lie slanting in the sun.</l>
                        <l>Here's a steamerânow we're in itâone is passing every minute;</l>
                        <l>There's the palace of St. Stephen, which they call âa dream in
                            stone;â</l>
                        <l>But I think, beyond all question, it was in an indigestion</l>
                        <l>That the architect devised those scrolls whose language is unknown.</l>
                        <l>Now we pass the Lollards' Tower as we glide upon our journey,</l>
                        <l>And think of Wicliffe's ashes scattered wide across the sea;</l>
                        <l>Pass the site of ancient Ranelagh, which (<foreign lang="lat">vide</foreign> Fanny Burney)</l>
                        <l>Brings up the tales we read at school to Laurence and to me.</l>
                        <l>At last we get to Putney, and we rush across the river,</l>

                        <l>The gentle rural river, flowing softly through the grass;</l>
                        <l>And we walk more fast than ever, for our nerves are in a quiver,</l>
                        <l>Till we mount the hill of Wimbledon, and see the shadows pass</l>
                        <l>Athwart the budding chestnuts, and clear brown water lying,</l>
                        <l>Fill'd with the click of insects, among the yellowing gorse;</l>
                        <l>Here there is no human creature, and the only living feature</l>
                        <l>Of all this glorious common is that idle old white horse;</l>
                        <l>And he is very happy, cropping herbage fresh and sappy,</l>
                        <l>And stretching out his tired legs through all the lonely day,â</l>

                        <l>The grand grey tower which Wren designedâand the common melts away;</l>
                        <l>I am on the lilied Avon, and among the Stratford fairies,</l>
                        <l>I am on my own dear Avon, a happy child at play;â</l>
                        <l>I rememberâthis is Middlesexâsweet vision, wilt not stay?</l>

                        <l>It is, indeed, a day of days, the sunlight grows more mellow,</l>
                        <l>As the sun goes softly sloping down towards the woods of Combe;</l>

                        <l>Oh, Laurence! when a judge, and wise in all the learned fudge</l>
                        <l>Of that book I shut this morning, and on your way to riches,</l>
                        <l>When, in ample wig and sleeve, your guineas you receive,</l>
                        <l>They'll not be half so golden as the primrose in these ditches.</l>
                        <l>See, they drop about the ground, and sing without a sound,</l>
                        <l>Thick clusters of anemones, and primrose-roots by dozens;</l>
                        <l>Saucy blooms without a measure blow in wantonness of pleasure,</l>

                        <l>If you want to catch a linnet, try if salt has virtue in it,</l>
                        <l>But leave dear bunny scatheless, and poor fish without a hook.</l>

                            <l><hi>ALAS</hi>! they have stolen my Fairy Princess,</l>
                            <l>And where they have hidden her I cannot guess.</l>
                            <l>But my life is so lonely without her, I ride</l>
                            <l>Up by the mountain and down by the tide;</l>
                            <l>I've asked of her Father, I've asked of her Mother,</l>
                            <l>But they cannot tell, or they will not discover,</l>
                            <l>And Men, when I question them, laugh me to scorn,</l>
                            <l>And no one has seen her since yesterday morn!</l>
                            <l>I went to the wood, and I asked of the Leaves;</l>
                            <l>But they have a whispering way that deceives;</l>
                            <l>And the Oak and the Elm, when they will, can entwine,</l>

                            <l>The thickest of screens with the Ivy and Vine.</l>
                            <l>I went to the Wind, who replied with a scoff,</l>
                            <l>He had met her, 'twas true; but a longish way off!</l>
                            <l>And then the wild fellow swept over the hill,</l>
                            <l>And all in the wake of his bluster was still.</l>
                            <l>I went to the Water, who promised a vision,</l>
                            <l>Then suddenly rippled in bursts of derision,</l>
                            <l>And asked if I thought he was likely to know</l>
                            <l>Who had look'd in his mirror an hour ago!</l>
                            <l>(But ah! if one moment she smiled in my eyes,</l>
                            <l>Within them for ever the memory lies!)</l>
                            <l>I went to the Flowers; but the secrets she knows</l>
                            <l>Are tightly curled up in the heart of the Rose,</l>
                            <l>And nothing that lovers can swear or forget</l>
                            <l>Is ever betrayed by the dear Mignonette.</l>
                            <l>The pale Water-lily lies open and bare,</l>
                            <l>So openly calm that no story is there;</l>
                            <l>The Hawthorn is busy in painting her bloom,</l>
                            <l>And shakes her frail head with a burst of perfume;</l>

                            <l>Where she lies fast asleepâin the heart of the hills!</l>

                        <l>Where near three thousand years ago the ancient Veii stood;</l>
                        <l>There's not a sound of life there now, where wandering alleys meet,</l>
                        <l>The cyclamen and violet grow purple in the street!</l>
                        <l>The glens are deep and leafy, the fields are green and bare,</l>
                        <l>And only scattered pottery tells that arts and trade were there,</l>
                        <l>And looking towards the Alban Mount across the solemn plains,</l>
                        <l>The ground on which we stand is all of Veii that remains.</l>

                        <l>A hundred thousand people once dwelt upon this hill,</l>
                        <l>Within their many towered walls the hum was never still.</l>
                        <l>The sculptor and the armourer worked as soon as it was light,</l>
                        <l>And watchman unto watchman called through all the starry night.</l>
                        <l>They had laws and arts, and customs, and altars to revere,</l>
                        <l>They buried with a solemn care the dead whom they held dear,</l>
                        <l>Whom they crowned with golden ivy and with oak-leaves never sere.</l>
                        <l>And the city on the hill-top where this people had their home,</l>
                        <l>Was a larger town than Athens and a mightier town than Rome.</l>
                        <l>A wondrous place is Veii, and the grandeur of her past</l>

                        <l>See the faces of her people, hear the voices of her crowd,</l>
                        <l>See the waving of her banners, hear the tramp of armed men,</l>
                        <l>Where nothing but the waterfall is dashing down the glen.</l>
                        <l>Other cities have their columned hills and fragments of their walls,</l>
                        <l>Or at least their ruined temples, on which the moonlight falls.</l>
                        <l>Other cities have their solemn sights, to which the pilgrim turns,</l>
                        <l>And some altar of tradition where a lamp for ever burns;</l>
                        <l>A ballad or a legend, or a few memorial stones,</l>

                        <l>Save her graves within the hill-side and a patch of ruined wall,</l>
                        <l>And the rocks cut sheer to guard her, and the streams that flow the
                            same,</l>
                        <l>And (foreign to the pilgrim's lips) the accents of her name!</l>

                    <head>NOTES TO UNDER THE OLIVES.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> Sahel of Algiers is the range of hills lying between the sea and
                        the Atlas Mountains. They are of an average elevation of 600 feet, but
                        occasionally attain much greater height. This belt of hills is exceedingly
                        rich and fertile in vegetation, and is cut by numerous deep ravines whose
                        sides are clothed with large olive-trees, with ilex, lentisk, aloes,
                        cactuses, and a profuse undergrowth of shrubs and wild flowers. In some
                        places a narrow plain intervenes between the hills and the sea, but at the
                        town itself this plain becomes a mere strip covered by the great square and
                        two streets east and west, at the back of which the houses mount the hill
                        abruptly, divided by steep narrow streets, which frequently break off into
                        steps, and up which no vehicle can pass. On each side of the town the slopes
                        are dotted with country houses and lovely gardens. The Gardens of the
                        Hesperides are placed by the poets somewhere at the feet of the Atlas
                        Mountains, whose snowy summits can be seen from the Sahel of Algiers.</p>
                    <p>Carthagenian history affords our first record of this part of the northern
                        coast of Africa. It is uncertain whether any town then occupied the exact
                        site of Algiers; but Iol, situated<pb n="214" id="VAB7022-214"/> rather
                        more to the west, near to the modern site of Cherchell, was a flourishing
                        colony; and the coast-line belonged to the Carthaginian rule. The familiar
                        story of the fall of Carthage has been lately illustrated by Dr. Davis's
                        excavations on the deserted plain where once the imperial city stood. In
                        1857 the writer visited this plain with an English party, to whom Dr. Davis
                        explained his operations. The site of the Byrsa, or citadel, has been a
                        subject of vivid contention among antiquaries; and the traveller, looking
                        over the immense tract of undulating ground, covered with shapeless lumps of
                        ruins, can discover no elevation sufficiently marked to settle the question.
                        We were told of a hill honeycombed with graves, and dangerous from the wild
                        beasts infesting the labyrinth; we saw the huge underground cisterns
                        described more than a hundred years ago by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu;
                        andâmore impressive than any thing elseâa huge flight of steps, partly hewn
                        in the living rock, and partly aided by blocks of masonry, which steps led
                        from the summit of a low cliff, once crowned by a temple, down to the
                        sea-shore. Nothing in architecture is so suggestive of the presence of man
                        as a flight of steps, and nothing so expressive of utter desolation as such
                        a vast, grass-grown, half-obliterated flight of steps, trodden by human feet
                        no more.</p>
                    <p>The next era commemorated in this poem is that of Roman domination. We know
                        that a Roman port named Icosium occupied the exact site of the town at

                        barren by fever, was once covered with cornfields, and was called the
                        Granary of Rome. Communication was then, of course, frequent between Rome
                        and Africa; there is now no means of communication, except by a return to
                        Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>The poem next touches upon the old glories of the Christian Church in Africa.
                        St. Augustin, born in the fourth century at Tagaste, not far from Carthage,
                        was converted by the incessant prayers of his mother, St. Monica, and lived
                        and died Bishop of Hippo. Hippo is now entirely ruined and deserted, and the
                        nearest modern town is Bona, which, like many other of these coast
                        settlements, is half French, half Moorish. The remains of a fine old Roman
                        aqueduct connect Bona with historic times, and give to the church-bells,
                        ringing out loud and sweet to call the French population to divine service,
                        the effect of being in some sense an echo of the past.</p>
                    <p>The long roll of African martyrdoms is not unfamiliar to readers of history.
                        The African Jerome, beheaded; Cyril, burnt alive with nine others; Marcelin,
                        executed at Carthage; St. Felix, beaten to death; St. Severin and his wife
                        St. Aquila, burnt at Julia CÃ¦sarea (the Roman name of Iol, now the modern
                        Cherchell); and Marciana, the virgin martyr, devoured by wild beasts in the
                        great stone amphitheatre of the same city, on the 11th of July, about the
                        year 305, are a few out of hundreds of lives sacrificed and names
                        recorded.</p>

                    <p>Christianity, trampled out by the barbarians who overran the Roman
                        settlements, and still farther excluded by the Mahometan Conquest, was only
                        kept alive on these wild and beautiful shores by the European slaves who
                        were constantly captured by the pirates, and by the devoted ministers of
                        religion who came from Italy and Spain to lose their lives at short
                        successive intervals while ministering to the captives.</p>
                    <p>The re-establishment of Christianity, under French rule, in 1830âthe conquest
                        of Algiers having been the last act of the Government of Charles the
                        Tenthâand the gradual development of the ecclesiastical and educational
                        institutions of the three provinces of Algeria, afford a deeply interesting
                        spectacle to those who recall the ancient history of the Church in
                        Africa.</p>
