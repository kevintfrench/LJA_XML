          <p>MANY years ago, I contracted an intimacy with a Mr. William
Legrand.  He was of an ancient Huguenot family, and had once
been wealthy; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want:
To avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters,
he left New Orleans, the city of his forefathers, and took up his
residence at Sullivan's Island, near Charleston, South Carolina.</p>
          <p>This Island is a very singular one.  It consists of little else
than the sea sand, and is about three miles long.  Its breadth
at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile. It is separated from the
main land by a scarcely perceptible creek, oozing its way through
a wilderness of reeds and slime, a favorite resort of the marsh
hen. The vegetation, as might be supposed, is scant, or at least
dwarfish.  No trees of any magnitude are to be seen.  Near the
western extremity, where Fort Moultrie stands, and where are
some miserable frame buildings, tenanted, during summer, by the
fugitives from Charleston dust and fever, may be found, indeed,
the bristly palmetto; but the whole island, with the exception of
this western point, and a line of hard, white beach on the seacoast,
is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet myrtle,
<pb id="poe2" n="2"/>
so much prized by the horticulturists of England.  The shrub
here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and forms
an almost impenetrable coppice, burthening the air with its fragrance.</p>
          <p>In the inmost recesses of this coppice, not far from the eastern
or more remote end of the island, Legrand had built himself a
small hut, which he occupied when I first, by mere accident,
made his acquaintance.  This soon ripened into friendship— for
there was much in the recluse to excite interest and esteem.  I
found him well educated, with unusual powers of mind, but infected
with misanthropy, and subject to perverse moods of alternate
enthusiasm and melancholy.  He had with him many books,
but rarely employed them.  His chief amusements were gunning
and fishing, or sauntering along the beach and through the myrtles, in
quest of shells or entomological specimens; —his collection
of the latter might have been envied by a Swammerdamm.  In these
excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro, called
Jupiter, who had been manumitted before the reverses of the family,
but who could be induced, neither by threats nor by promises, to
abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the
footsteps of his young “Massa Will.”  It is not improbable that the
relatives of Legrand, conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in
intellect, had contrived to instil this obstinacy into Jupiter, with a
view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer.</p>
          <p>The winters in the latitude of Sullivan's Island are seldom very
severe, and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire
is considered necessary.  About the middle of October, 18—, there
occurred, however, a day of remarkable chilliness.  Just before
sunset I scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of
my friend, whom I had not visited for several weeks—my residence
being, at that time, in Charleston, a distance of nine miles from the
Island, while the facilities of passage and re-passage were very far
behind those of the present day.  Upon reaching the hut I rapped, as
was my custom, and getting no reply, sought for the key where I
knew it was secreted, unlocked the door and went in.  A fine
fire was blazing upon the hearth.  It was a novelty, and by no
means an ungrateful one.  I
<pb id="poe3" n="3"/>
threw off an overcoat, took an arm-chair by the crackling logs, and
awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts.</p>
          <p>Soon after dark they arrived, and gave me a most cordial welcome.
Jupiter, grinning from ear to ear, bustled about to prepare
some marsh-hens for supper.  Legrand was in one of his fits—how
else shall I term them?—of enthusiasm.  He had found an unknown
bivalve, forming a new genus, and, more than this, he had hunted
down and secured, with Jupiter's assistance, a 
<hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi> which he
believed to be totally new, but in respect to which he wished to
have my opinion on the morrow.</p>
          <p>“And why not to-night?” I asked, rubbing my hands over the
blaze, and wishing the whole tribe of<hi rend="italics"> scarabæi</hi> at the devil.</p>
          <p>“Ah, if I had only known you were here!” said Legrand, “but
it's so long since I saw you; and how could I foresee that you
would pay me a visit this very night of all others?  As I was
coming home I met Lieutenant G---, from the fort, and, very
foolishly, I lent him the bug; so it will be impossible for you to
see it until the morning.  Stay here to-night, and I will send Jup
down for it at sunrise.  It is the loveliest thing in creation!”</p>
          <p>“What?—sunrise?”</p>
          <p>“Nonsense! no!—the bug.  It is of a brilliant gold color  -
about
the size of a large hickory-nut—with two jet black spots near one
extremity of the back, and another, somewhat longer, at the other.
The <hi rend="italics">antennæ</hi> are—”</p>
          <p>“Dey aint <hi rend="italics">no</hi> tin in him, Massa Will, I
keep a tellin on you,”
here interrupted Jupiter; “de bug is a goole bug, solid, ebery bit of
him, inside and all, sep him wing—neber feel half so hebby a bug in
my life.”</p>
          <p>“Well, suppose it is, Jup,” replied Legrand, somewhat more
earnestly, it seemed to me, than the case demanded, “is that any
reason for your letting the birds burn?  The color”—here he turned
to me—“is really almost enough to warrant Jupiter's idea.  You
never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit—but
of this you cannot judge till tomorrow.  In the mean time I can give
you some idea of the shape.”  Saying this, he seated himself at a
small table, on which were a pen and ink, but no paper.  He looked
for some in a drawer, but found none.</p>
          <p>“Never mind,” said he at length, “this will answer;” and he
<pb id="poe4" n="4"/>
drew from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what I took to be very dirty
foolscap, and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen.  While
he did this, I retained my seat by the fire, for I was still chilly.
When the design was complete, he handed it to me without rising.
As I received it, a loud growl was heard, succeeded by a scratching
at the door.  Jupiter opened it, and a large Newfoundland, belonging
to Legrand, rushed in, leaped upon my shoulders, and loaded me
with caresses; for I had shown him much attention during previous
visits.  When his gambols were over, I looked at the paper, and, to
speak the truth, found myself not a little puzzled at what my
friend had depicted.</p>
          <p>“Well!” I said, after contemplating it for some minutes, “this <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
a strange <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>, I must confess: new to me: never saw
anything like it before—unless it was a skull, or a death's-head—
which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come
under <hi rend="italics">my</hi> observation.”</p>
          <p>“A death's-head!” echoed Legrand—“Oh—yes—well, it has
something of that appearance upon paper, no doubt.  The two upper
black spots look like eyes, eh? and the longer one at the bottom like
a mouth—and then the shape of the whole is oval.”</p>
          <p>“Perhaps so,” said I; “but, Legrand, I fear you are no artist.  I
must wait until I see the beetle itself, if I am to form any idea of
its personal appearance.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I don't know,” said he, a little nettled, “I
draw tolerably—<hi rend="italics">should</hi> do it at least—have had good
masters, and flatter
myself that I am not quite a blockhead.”</p>
          <p>“But, my dear fellow, you are joking then,” said I,
“this is a very
passable <hi rend="italics">skull</hi>—indeed, I may say that it is a
very <hi rend="italics">excellent</hi> skull,
according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of
physiology—and your <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi> must be
the queerest <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>
in the world if it resembles it.  Why, we may get up a very thrilling
bit of superstition upon this hint.  I presume you will call the bug
<foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">scarabæus
caput hominis</hi></foreign>, or something of that kind—there are
many similar titles in the Natural Histories.  But where are the
<hi rend="italics">antennæ</hi> you spoke of?”</p>
          <p>“The <hi rend="italics">antennæ</hi>!” said Legrand,
who seemed to be getting
unaccountably warm upon the subject; “I am sure you must see
<pb id="poe5" n="5"/>
the<hi rend="italics"> antennæ</hi>.  I made them as distinct as
they are in the original
insect, and I presume that is sufficient.”</p>
          <p>“Well, well,” I said, “perhaps you have—still I
don't see them;”
and I handed him the paper without additional remark, not wishing
to ruffle his temper; but I was much surprised at the turn affairs had
taken; his ill humor puzzled me—and, as for the drawing of the
beetle, there were positively<hi rend="italics"> no antennæ</hi>
visible, and the whole <hi rend="italics">did</hi>
bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a death's-head.</p>
          <p>He received the paper very peevishly, and was about to crumple
it, apparently to throw it in the fire, when a casual glance at the
design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention.  In an instant his face
grew violently red—in another as excessively pale.  For some
minutes he continued to scrutinize the drawing minutely where he
sat.  At length he arose, took a candle from the table, and proceeded
to seat himself upon a sea-chest in the farthest corner of the room.
Here again he made an anxious examination of the paper; turning it
in all directions.  He said nothing, however, and his conduct greatly
astonished me; yet I thought it prudent not to exacerbate the
growing moodiness of his temper by any comment.  Presently he
took from his coat pocket a wallet, placed the paper carefully in it,
and deposited both in a writing-desk, which he locked.  He now
grew more composed in his demeanor; but his original air of
enthusiasm had quite disappeared.  Yet he seemed not so much
sulky as abstracted.  As the evening wore away he became more and
more absorbed in reverie, from which no sallies of mine could arouse
him.  It had been my intention to pass the night at the hut, as I had
frequently done before, but, seeing my host in this mood, I deemed
it proper to take leave.  He did not press me to remain, but, as I
departed, he shook my hand with even more than his usual
cordiality.</p>
          <p>It was about a month after this (and during the interval I had seen
nothing of Legrand) when I received a visit, at Charleston, from his
man, Jupiter.  I had never seen the good old negro look so dispirited,
and I feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend.</p>
          <p>“Well, Jup,” said I, “what is the matter now?—
how is your
master?”</p>
          <pb id="poe6" n="6"/>
          <p>“Why, to speak de troof, massa, him not so berry well as mought
be.”</p>
          <p>“Not well!  I am truly sorry to hear it.  What does he complain
of?”</p>
          <p>“Dar! dat's it!—him neber plain of notin—but him berry sick
for all dat.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Very</hi> sick, Jupiter!—why didn't you
say so at once? Is he
confined to bed?”</p>
          <p>“No, dat he aint!—he aint find nowhar—dat's just whar de
shoe
pinch—my mind is got to be berry hebby bout poor Massa Will.”</p>
          <p>“Jupiter, I should like to understand what it is you are talking
 about.  You say your master is sick.  Hasn't he told you what ails
him?”</p>
          <p>“Why, massa, taint worf while for to git mad about de matter—
Massa Will say noffin at all aint de matter wid him—but den
what make him go about looking dis here way, wid he head down and
he soldiers up, and as white as a gose?  And den he keep a syphon all
de time—”</p>
          <p>“Keeps a what, Jupiter?”</p>
          <p>“Keeps a syphon wid de figgurs on de slate—de queerest figgurs
I ebber did see.  Ise gittin to be skeered, I tell you.  Hab for to keep
mighty tight eye pon him noovers.  Todder day he gib me slip fore

ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did come—but
Ise sich a fool dat I hadn't de heart arter all—he look so berry
poorly.”</p>
          <p>“Eh?— what?—ah yes!—upon the whole I think you had better
not be too severe with the poor fellow—don't flog him, Jupiter—he can't very well stand it—but can you form no idea of what has
occasioned this illness, or rather this change of conduct?  Has
anything unpleasant happened since I saw you?”</p>
          <p>“No, massa, dey aint bin noffin unpleasant <hi rend="italics">since</hi> den—'twas <hi rend="italics">fore</hi>
den I'm feared—'twas de berry day you was dare.”</p>
          <p>“How? what do you mean?”</p>
          <p>“Why, massa, I mean de bug—dare now.”</p>
          <p>“The what?”</p>
          <p>“De bug,—I'm berry sartain dat Massa Will bin bit somewhere
bout de head by dat goole-bug.”</p>
          <pb id="poe7" n="7"/>
          <p>“And what cause have you, Jupiter, for such a supposition?”</p>
          <p>“Claws enuff, massa, and mouth too.  I nebber did see sick a deuced
bug—he kick and he bite ebery ting what cum near him.  Massa Will
cotch him fuss, but had for to let him go gin mighty quick, I tell
you—den was de time he must ha got de bite.  I did n't like de look
oh de bug mouff, myself, no how, so I would n't take hold ob him
wid my finger, but I cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat I found.  I
rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he mouff—dat was
de way.”</p>
          <p>“And you think, then, that your master was really bitten by the
beetle, and that the bite made him sick?”</p>
          <p>“I do n't tink noffin about it—I nose it.  What make him dream
bout de goole so much, if taint cause he bit by de goole-bug?  Ise
heerd bout dem goole-bugs fore dis.”</p>
          <p>“But how do you know he dreams about gold?”</p>
          <p>“How I know? why cause he talk about it in he sleep—dat's how I
nose.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Jup, perhaps you are right; but to what fortunate circumstance
am I to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day?”</p>
          <p>“What de matter, massa?”</p>
          <p>“Did you bring any message from Mr. Legrand ”</p>
          <p>“No, massa, I bring dis here pissel;” and here Jupiter handed me
a note which ran thus:</p>
          <div3 type="letter">
            <opener>
              <salute>MY DEAR ----</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Why have I not seen you for so long a time?  I hope you have not
been so foolish as to take offence at any little <hi rend="italics">brusquerie</hi> of mine;
but no, that is improbable.</p>
            <p>Since I saw you I have had great cause for anxiety.  I have
something to tell you, yet scarcely know how to tell it, or whether
I should tell it at all.</p>
            <p>I have not been quite well for some days past, and poor old Jup
annoys me, almost beyond endurance, by his well-meant attentions
Would you believe it?—he had prepared a huge stick, the
other day, with which to chastise me for giving him the slip, and
spending the day, <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">solus</hi></foreign>, among the hills on the main land.  I verily
believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging.</p>
            <p>I have made no addition to my cabinet since we met.
<pb id="poe8" n="8"/>
If you can, in any way, make it convenient, come over with Jupiter.
<hi rend="italics">Do</hi> come. I wish to see you <hi rend="italics">to-night</hi>, upon business of
importance.  I assure you that it is of the <hi rend="italics">highest</hi> importance.</p>
            <closer><salute>Ever yours, </salute>                  <signed> WILLIAM LEGRAND.</signed></closer>
          </div3>
          <div3>
            <p>There was something in the tone of this note which gave me great
uneasiness.  Its whole style differed materially from that of Legrand.
What could he be dreaming of?  What new crotchet possessed his
excitable brain?  What “business of the highest importance” could
<hi rend="italics">he</hi> possibly have to transact?  Jupiter's account of him boded no
good.  I dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had, at
length, fairly unsettled the reason of my friend.  Without a moment's
hesitation, therefore, I prepared to accompany the negro.</p>
            <p>Upon reaching the wharf, I noticed a scythe and three spades, all
apparently new, lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were
to embark.</p>
            <p>“What is the meaning of all this, Jup?” I inquired.</p>
            <p>“Him syfe, massa, and spade.”</p>
            <p>“Very true; but what are they doing here?”</p>
            <p>“Him de syfe and de spade what Massa Will sis pon my buying for
him in de town, and de debbils own lot of money I had to gib for
em.”</p>
            <p>“But what, in the name of all that is mysterious, is your ‘Massa
Will’ going to do with scythes and spades?”</p>
            <p>“Dat's more dan <hi rend="italics">I</hi> know, and debbil take me if I don't blieve 'tis
more dan he know, too.  But it's all cum ob do bug.”</p>
            <p>Finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of Jupiter, whose
whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by “de bug,” I now stepped
into the boat and made sail.  With a fair and strong breeze we soon
ran into the little cove to the northward of Fort Moultrie, and a
walk of some two miles brought us to the hut.  It was about three in
the afternoon when we arrived.  Legrand had been awaiting us in
eager expectation.  He grasped my hand with a nervous
<hi rend="italics">empressement</hi> which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions
already entertained.  His countenance was pale even to ghastliness,
and his deep-set eyes glared with unnatural lustre.  After some
inquiries respecting his health, I asked him,
<pb id="poe9" n="9"/>
not knowing what better to say, if he had yet obtained the
<hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi> from Lieutenant G ----.</p>
            <p>“Oh, yes,” he replied, coloring violently, “I got it from him the
next morning.  Nothing should tempt me to part with that
<hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>.  Do you know that Jupiter is quite right about it?”</p>
            <p>“In what way?” I asked, with a sad foreboding at heart.</p>
            <p>“In supposing it to be a bug of <hi rend="italics">real gold</hi>.”  He said this with an
air of profound seriousness, and I felt inexpressibly shocked.</p>
            <p>“This bug is to make my fortune,” he continued, with a
triumphant smile, “to reinstate me in my family possessions.  Is it
any wonder, then, that I prize it?  Since Fortune has thought fit to
bestow it upon me, I have only to use it properly and I shall arrive
at the gold of which it is the index.  Jupiter; bring me that <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>!”</p>
            <p>“What! de bug, massa?  I'd rudder not go fer trubble dat
bug—you mus git him for your own self.”  Hereupon Legrand arose,
with a grave and stately air, and brought me the beetle from a glass
case in which it was enclosed.  It was a beautiful <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>, and, at
that time, unknown to naturalists—of course a great prize in a
scientific point of view.  There were two round, black spots near one
extremity of the back, and a long one near the other.  The scales were
exceedingly hard and glossy, with all the appearance of burnished
gold.  The weight of the insect was very remarkable, and, taking all
things into consideration, I could hardly blame Jupiter for his
opinion respecting it; but what to make of Legrand's concordance
with that opinion, I could not, for the life of me, tell.</p>
            <p>“I sent for you,” said he, in a grandiloquent tone, when I had
completed my examination of the beetle, “I sent for you, that I
might have your counsel and assistance in furthering the views of
Fate and of the bug”—</p>
            <p>“My dear Legrand,” I cried, interrupting him, “you are certainly
unwell, and had better use some little precautions.  You shall
go to bed, and I will remain with you a few days, until you get
over this.  You are feverish and”—</p>
            <p>“Feel my pulse,” said he.</p>
            <p>I felt it, and, to say the truth, found not the slightest indication of fever.</p>
            <pb id="poe10" n="10"/>
            <p>“But you may be ill and yet have no fever.  Allow me this once
to prescribe for you.  In the first place, go to bed.  In the next”—</p>
            <p>“You are mistaken,” he interposed, “I am as well as I can expect
to be under the excitement which I suffer.  If you really wish me
well, you will relieve this excitement.”</p>
            <p>“And how is this to be done?”</p>
            <p>“Very easily.  Jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition
into the hills, upon the main land, and, in this expedition we shall
need the aid of some person in whom we can confide.  You are the
only one we can trust.  Whether we succeed or fail, the excitement
which you now perceive in me will be equally allayed.”</p>
            <p>“I am anxious to oblige you in any way,” I replied; “but do you
mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with
your expedition into the hills?”</p>
            <p>“It has.”</p>
            <p>“Then, Legrand, I can become a party to no such absurd proceeding.”</p>
            <p>“I am sorry—very sorry—for we shall have to try it by ourselves.”</p>
            <p>“Try it by yourselves!  The man is surely mad!—but stay!
—how long do you propose to be absent?”</p>
            <p>“Probably all night.  We shall start immediately, and be back, at
all events, by sunrise.”</p>
            <p>“And will you promise me, upon your honor, that when this
freak of yours is over, and the bug business (good God!) settled to
your satisfaction, you will then return home and follow my advice
implicitly, as that of your physician?”</p>
            <p>“Yes; I promise; and now let us be off, for we have no time to
lose.”</p>
            <p>With a heavy heart I accompanied my friend.  We started about
four o'clock—Legrand, Jupiter, the dog, and myself.  Jupiter had
with him the scythe and spades—the whole of which he insisted
upon carrying—more through fear, it seemed to me, of trusting
either of the implements within reach of his master, than from any
excess of industry or complaisance.  His demeanor was dogged in
the extreme, and “dat deuced bug” were the sole
<pb id="poe11" n="11"/>
words which escaped his lips during the journey.  For my own part,
I had charge of a couple of dark lanterns, while Legrand contented
himself with the <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>, which he carried attached to the end
of a bit of whip-cord; twirling it to and fro, with the air of a
conjuror, as he went.  When I observed this last, plain evidence of
my friend's aberration of mind, I could scarcely refrain from tears.  I
thought it best, however, to humor his fancy, at least for the
present, or until I could adopt some more energetic measures with a
chance of success.  In the mean time I endeavored, but all in vain, to
sound him in regard to the object of the expedition.  Having
succeeded in inducing me to accompany him, he seemed unwilling to
hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance, and to all my
questions vouchsafed no other reply than “we shall see!”</p>
            <p>We crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a
skiff; and, ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land,
proceeded in a northwesterly direction, through a tract of country
excessively wild and desolate, where no trace of a human footstep
was to be seen.  Legrand led the way with decision; pausing only
for an instant, here and there, to consult what appeared to be certain
landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion.</p>
            <p>In this manner we journeyed for about two hours, and the sun
was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary
than any yet seen.  It was a species of table land, near the summit
of an almost inaccessible hill, densely wooded from base to
pinnacle, and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie
loosely upon the soil, and in many cases were prevented from
precipitating themselves into the valleys below, merely by the
support of the trees against which they reclined.  Deep ravines, in
various directions, gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene.</p>
            <p>The natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly
overgrown with brambles, through which we soon discovered that it
would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe;
and Jupiter, by direction of his master, proceeded to clear for us a
path to the foot of an enormously tall tulip-tree, which stood, with
some eight or ten oaks, upon the level, and far surpassed them
<pb id="poe12" n="12"/>
all, and all other trees which I had then ever seen, in the beauty of
its foliage and form, in the wide spread of its branches, and in the
general majesty of its appearance.  When we reached this tree,
Legrand turned to Jupiter, and asked him if he thought he could
climb it.  The old man seemed a little staggered by the question, and
for some moments made no reply.  At length he approached the huge
trunk, walked slowly around it, and examined it with minute
attention.  When he had completed his scrutiny, he merely said,</p>
            <p>“Yes, massa, Jup climb any tree he ebber see in he life.”</p>
            <p>“Then up with you as soon as possible, for it will soon be too
dark to see what we are about.”</p>
            <p>“How far mus go up, massa?” inquired Jupiter.</p>
            <p>“Get up the main trunk first, and then I will tell you which way
to go—and here—stop! take this beetle with you.”</p>
            <p>“De bug, Massa Will!—de goole bug!” cried the negro, drawing
back in dismay—“what for mus tote de bug way up de tree?
—d--n if I do!”</p>
            <p>“If you are afraid, Jup, a great big negro like you, to take hold of a
harmless little dead beetle, why you can carry it up by this
string—but, if you do not take it up with you in some way, I shall
be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel.”</p>
            <p>“What de matter now, massa?” said Jup, evidently shamed into
compliance; “always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger.  Was only
funnin any how.  Me feered de bug! what I keer for de bug?”  Here
he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string, and,
maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would
permit, prepared to ascend the tree.</p>
            <p>In youth, the tulip-tree, or <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Liriodendron Tulipferum</hi></foreign>, the most
magnificent of American foresters, has a trunk peculiarly smooth,
and often rises to a great height without lateral branches; but, in its
riper age, the bark becomes gnarled and uneven, while many short
limbs make their appearance on the stem.  Thus the difficulty of
ascension, in the present case, lay more in semblance than in reality.
Embracing the huge cylinder, as closely as possible, with his arms
and knees, seizing with his hands some projections, and resting his
naked toes upon others, Jupiter, after one
<pb id="poe13" n="13"/>
or two narrow escapes from falling, at length wriggled himself into the
first great fork, and seemed to consider the whole business as
virtually accomplished.  The <hi rend="italics">risk</hi> of the achievement was, in fact,
now over, although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet
from the ground.</p>
            <p>“Which way mus go now, Massa Will?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“Keep up the largest branch—the one on this side,” said Legrand.
The negro obeyed him promptly, and apparently with but little trouble;
ascending higher and higher, until no glimpse of his squat figure could
be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it.  Presently his
voice was heard in a sort of halloo.</p>
            <p>“How much fudder is got for go?”</p>
            <p>“How high up are you?” asked Legrand.</p>
            <p>“Ebber so fur,” replied the negro; “can see de sky fru de top ob
de tree.”</p>
            <p>“Never mind the sky, but attend to what I say.  Look down
the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side.  How
many limbs have you passed?”</p>
            <p>“One, two, tree, four, fibe—I done pass fibe big limb, massa,
pon dis side.”</p>
            <p>“Then go one limb higher.”</p>
            <p>In a few minutes the voice was heard again, announcing that the
seventh limb was attained.</p>
            <p>“Now, Jup,” cried Legrand, evidently much excited, “I want
you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can.  If you
see anything strange, let me know.”</p>
            <p>By this time what little doubt I might have entertained of my
poor friend's insanity, was put finally at rest. I had no alternative
but to conclude him stricken with lunacy, and I became seriously
anxious about getting him home. While I was pondering upon what
was best to be done, Jupiter's voice was again heard.</p>
            <p>“Mos feerd for to ventur pon dis limb berry far—tis dead limb
putty much all de way.”</p>
            <p>“Did you say it was a<hi rend="italics"> dead</hi> limb, Jupiter?” cried Legrand in a
quavering voice.</p>
            <p>“Yes, massa, him dead as de door-nail—done up for
sartain—done departed dis here life.”</p>
            <pb id="poe14" n="14"/>
            <p>“What in the name heaven shall I do?” asked Legrand, seemingly
in the greatest distress.</p>
            <p>“Do!” said I, glad of an opportunity to interpose a word, “why
come home and go to bed.  Come now!—that's a fine fellow.  It's
getting late, and, besides, you remember your promise.”</p>
            <p>“Jupiter,” cried he, without heeding me in the least, “do you
hear me?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, Massa Will, hear you ebber so plain.”</p>
            <p>“Try the wood well, then, with your knife, and see if you think
it <hi rend="italics">very</hi> rotten.”</p>
            <p>“Him rotten, massa, sure nuff,” replied the negro in a few
moments, “but not so berry rotten as mought be.  Mought ventur
out leetle way pon de limb by myself, dat's true.”</p>
            <p>“By yourself!—what do you mean?”</p>
            <p>“Why I mean de bug.  'Tis <hi rend="italics">berry</hi> hebby bug.  Spose I drop him
down fuss, and den de limb won't break wid just de weight ob one
nigger.”</p>
            <p>“You infernal scoundrel!” cried Legrand, apparently much
relieved, “what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that?
As sure as you drop that beetle I'll break your neck.  Look here,
Jupiter, do you hear me?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, massa, needn't hollo at poor nigger dat style.”</p>
            <p>“Well! now listen!—if you will venture out on the limb as far as
you think safe, and not let go the beetle, I'll make you a present of a
silver dollar as soon as you get down.”</p>
            <p>“I'm gwine, Massa Will—deed I is,” replied the negro very
promptly—“mos out to the <sic>eend</sic> now.”</p>
            <p>“<hi rend="italics">Out to the end!</hi>” here fairly screamed Legrand, “do you say you
are out to the end of that limb?”</p>
            <p>“Soon be to de eend, massa,—o-o-o-o-oh!  Lor-gol-a-marcy!  what
is dis here pon de tree?”</p>
            <p>“Well!” cried Legrand, highly delighted, “what is it?”</p>
            <p>“Why taint noffin but a skull—somebody bin lef him head up
de tree, and de crows done gobble ebery bit ob de meat off.”</p>
            <p>“A skull, you say!—very well!—how is it fastened to the
limb?—what holds it on?”</p>
            <p>“Sure nuff, massa; mus look.  Why dis berry curous sarcumstance,
<pb id="poe15" n="15"/>
pon my word—dare's a great big nail in de skull, what fastens ob
it on to de tree.”</p>
            <p>“Well now, Jupiter, do exactly as I tell you—do you hear?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, massa.”</p>
            <p>“Pay attention, then!—find the left eye of the skull.”</p>
            <p>“Hum! hoo! dat's good! why dare aint no eye lef at all.”</p>
            <p>“Curse your stupidity! do you know your right hand from
your left?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I nose dat—nose all bout dat—tis my lef hand what I
chops de wood wid.”</p>
            <p>“To be sure! you are left-handed; and your left. eye is on
the same side as your left hand.  Now, I suppose, you can find the left
eye of the skull, or the place where the left eye has been.  Have you
found it?”</p>
            <p>Here was a long pause.  At length the negro asked,</p>
            <p>“Is de lef eye of de skull pon de same side as de lef hand of de
skull, too?—cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at
all—nebber mind!  I got de lef eye now—here de lef eye!  what
mus do wid it?”</p>
            <p>“Let the beetle drop through it, as far as the string will
reach—but he careful and not let go your hold of the string.”</p>
            <p>“All dat done, Massa Will; mighty easy ting for to put de bug
fru de hole—look out for him dare below!”</p>
            <p>During this colloquy no portion of Jupiter's person could be seen;
but the beetle, which he had suffered to descend, was now visible at
the end of the string, and glistened, like a globe of burnished gold,
in the last rays of the setting sun, some of which still faintly
illumined the eminence upon which we stood.  The <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>
hung quite clear of any branches, and, if allowed to fall, would
have fallen at our feet.  Legrand immediately took the scythe,
and cleared with it a circular space, three or four yards in diameter,
just beneath the insect, and, having accomplished this, ordered
Jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree.</p>
            <p>Driving a peg, with great nicety, into the ground, at the precise
spot where the beetle fell, my friend now produced from his pocket
a tape measure.  Fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk,
of the tree which was nearest the peg, he unrolled it till it
<pb id="poe16" n="16"/>
reached the peg, and thence farther unrolled it, in the direction
already established by the two points of the tree and the peg, for the
distance of fifty feet—Jupiter clearing away the brambles with the
scythe.  At the spot thus attained a second peg was driven, and
about this, as a centre, a rude circle, about four feet in diameter,
described.  Taking now a spade himself, and giving one to Jupiter and
one to me, Legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as
possible.</p>
            <p>To speak the truth, I had no especial relish for such amusement
at any time, and, at that particular moment, would most willingly
have declined it; for the night was coming on, and I felt much
fatigued with the exercise already taken; but I saw no mode of
escape, and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend's equanimity
by a refusal.  Could I have depended, indeed, upon Jupiter's aid, I
would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home
by force; but I was too well assured of the old negro's disposition,
to hope that he would assist me, under any circumstances, in a
personal contest with his master.  I made no doubt that the latter had
been infected with some of the innumerable Southern superstitions
about money buried, and that his phantasy had received
confirmation by the finding of the <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>, or, perhaps, by
Jupiter's obstinacy in maintaining it to be “a bug of real gold.”  A
mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such
suggestions—especially if chiming in with favorite preconceived
ideas—and then I called to mind the poor fellow's speech about the
beetle's being “the index of his fortune.”  Upon the whole, I was
sadly vexed and puzzled, but, at length, I concluded to make a virtue
of necessity—to dig with a good will, and thus the sooner to
convince the visionary, by ocular demonstration, of the fallacy of
the opinions he entertained.</p>
            <p>The lanterns having been lit, we all fell to work with a zeal
worthy a more rational cause; and, as the glare fell upon our
persons and implements, I could not help thinking how picturesque
a group we composed, and how strange and suspicious our
labors must have appeared to any interloper who, by chance, might
have stumbled upon our whereabouts.</p>
            <p>We dug very steadily for two hours.  Little was said; and our
chief embarrassment lay in the yelpings of the dog, who took
<pb id="poe17" n="17"/>
exceeding interest in our proceedings.  He, at length, became so
obstreperous that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some
stragglers in the vicinity;—or, rather, this was the apprehension of
Legrand;—for myself, I should have rejoiced at any interruption
which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home. The noise
was, at length, very effectually silenced by Jupiter, who, getting out
of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation, tied the brute's mouth
up with one of his suspenders, and then returned, with a grave
chuckle, to his task.</p>
            <p>When the time mentioned had expired, we had reached a depth of
five feet, and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest.  A
general pause ensued, and I began to hope that the farce was at an
end.  Legrand, however, although evidently much disconcerted,
wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced.  We had excavated
the entire circle of four feet diameter, and now we slightly enlarged
the limit, and went to the farther depth of two feet.  Still nothing
appeared.  The gold-seeker, whom I sincerely pitied, at length
clambered from the pit, with the bitterest disappointment
imprinted upon every feature, and proceeded, slowly and
reluctantly, to put on his coat, which he had thrown off at the
beginning of his labor.  In the mean time I made no remark.  Jupiter,
at a signal from his master, began to gather up his tools.  This done,
and the dog having been unmuzzled, we turned in profound silence
towards home.</p>
            <p>We had taken, perhaps, a dozen steps in this direction, when,
with a loud oath, Legrand strode up to Jupiter, and seized him by
the collar.  The astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the
fullest extent, let fall the spades, and fell upon his knees.</p>
            <p>“You scoundrel,” said Legrand, hissing out the syllables from
between his clenched teeth—“you infernal black villain!—speak,
I tell you!—answer me this instant, without prevarication!—
which—which is your left eye?”</p>
            <p>“Oh, my golly, Massa Will! aint dis here my lef eye for sartain?”
roared the terrified Jupiter, placing his hand upon his <hi rend="italics">right</hi> organ
of vision, and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity, as if in
immediate dread of his master's attempt at a gouge.</p>
            <p>“I thought so!—I knew it! hurrah!” vociferated Legrand, letting
the negro go, and executing a series of curvets and caracols,
<pb id="poe18" n="18"/>
much to the astonishment of his valet, who, arising from his
knees, looked, mutely, from his master to myself, and then from
myself to his master.</p>
            <p>“Come! we must go back,” said the latter, “the game's not up
yet;” and he again led the way to the tulip-tree.</p>
            <p>“Jupiter,” said he, when we reached its foot, “come here! was
the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards, or with the face
to the limb?”</p>
            <p>“De face was out, massa, so dat de crows could get at de eyes
good, widout any trouble.”</p>
            <p>“Well, then, was it this eye or that through which you dropped
the beetle?”—here Legrand touched each of Jupiter's eyes.</p>
            <p>“Twas dis eye, massa—de lef eye—jis as you tell me,” and
here it was his right eye that the negro indicated.</p>
            <p>“That will do—must try it again.”</p>
            <p>Here my friend, about whose madness I now saw, or fancied that
I saw, certain indications of method, removed the peg which marked
the spot where the beetle fell, to a spot about three inches to the
westward of its former position.  Taking, now, the tape measure
from the nearest point of the trunk to the peg, as before, and
continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty
feet, a spot was indicated, removed, by several yards, from the
point at which we had been digging.</p>
            <p>Around the new position a circle, somewhat larger than in the former
instance, was now described, and we again set to work with the
spades.  I was dreadfully weary, but, scarcely understanding what
had occasioned the change in my thoughts, I felt no longer any great
aversion from the labor imposed.  I had become most unaccountably
interested—nay, even excited.  Perhaps there was something, amid
all the extravagant demeanor of Legrand—some air of forethought, or
of deliberation, which impressed me.  I dug eagerly, and now and
then caught myself actually looking, with something that very
much resembled expectation, for the fancied treasure, the vision of
which had demented my unfortunate companion.  At a period
when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me, and when
we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half, we were again
interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog.  His uneasiness,
in the first
<pb id="poe19" n="19"/>
instance, had been, evidently, but the result of playfulness or
caprice, but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone.  Upon
Jupiter's again attempting to muzzle him, he made furious resistance,
and, leaping into the hole, tore up the mould frantically with his
claws.  In a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones,
forming two complete skeletons, intermingled with several buttons
of metal, and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen.
One or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large Spanish
knife, and, as we dug farther, three or four loose pieces of gold and
silver coin came to light.</p>
            <p>At sight of these the joy of Jupiter could scarcely be restrained, but
the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment
He urged us, however, to continue our exertions, and the words
were hardly uttered when I stumbled and fell forward, having caught
the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the
loose earth.</p>
            <p>We now worked in earnest, and never did I pass ten minutes of
more intense excitement.  During this interval we had fairly unearthed
an oblong chest of wood, which, from its perfect preservation and
wonderful hardness, had plainly been subjected to some mineralizing
process—perhaps that of the Bi-chloride of Mercury.  This box was
three feet and a half long, three feet broad, and two and a half feet
deep.  It was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron, riveted, and
forming a kind of open trelliswork over the whole.  On each side of
the chest, near the top, were three rings of iron—six in all—by
means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons.  Our
utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the coffer very
slightly in its bed.  We at once saw the impossibility of removing so
great a weight.  Luckily, the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of
two sliding bolts.  These we drew back—trembling and panting with
anxiety.  In an instant, a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming
before us.  As the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit, there
flashed upwards a glow and a glare, from a confused heap of gold and
of jewels, that absolutely dazzled our eyes.</p>
            <p>I shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which I gazed.
Amazement was, of course, predominant.  Legrand appeared
exhausted with excitement, and spoke very few words.  Jupiter's
<pb id="poe20" n="20"/>
countenance wore, for some minutes, as deadly a pallor as it is
possible, in nature of things, for any negro's visage to assume.  He
seemed stupified—thunderstricken.  Presently he fell upon his knees
in the pit, and, burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold, let
them there remain, as if enjoying the luxury of a bath.  At length,
with a deep sigh, he exclaimed, as if in a soliloquy,</p>
            <p>“And dis all cum ob de goole-bug! de putty goole bug! de poor
little goole-bug, what I boosed in dat sabage kind ob style!  Aint
you shamed ob yourself, nigger?—answer me dat!”</p>
            <p>It became necessary, at last, that I should arouse both master and
valet to the expediency of removing the treasure.  It was growing late,
and it behooved us to make exertion, that we might get every thing
housed before daylight.  It was difficult to say what should be done,
and much time was spent in deliberation—so confused were the
ideas of all.  We, finally, lightened the box by removing two thirds of
its contents, when we were enabled, with some trouble, to raise it
from the hole.  The articles taken out were deposited among the
brambles, and the dog left to guard them, with strict orders from
Jupiter neither, upon any pretence, to stir from the spot, nor to
open his mouth until our return.  We then hurriedly made for
home with the chest; reaching the hut in safety, but after excessive
toil, at one o'clock in the morning.  Worn out as we were, it was
not in human nature to do more immediately.  We rested until two,
and had supper; starting for the hills immediately afterwards,
armed with three stout sacks, which, by good luck, were upon the
premises.  A little before four we arrived at the pit, divided the
remainder of the booty, as equally as might be, among us, and,
leaving the holes unfilled, again set out for the hut, at which, for the
second time, we deposited our golden burthens, just as the first
faint streaks of the dawn gleamed from over the tree-tops in the East.</p>
            <p>We were now thoroughly broken down; but the intense excitement
of the time denied us repose.  After an unquiet slumber of
some three or four hours' duration, we arose, as if by preconcert, to
make examination of our treasure.</p>
            <p>The chest had had been full to the brim, and we spent the whole
day, and the greater part of the next night, in a scrutiny of its
<pb id="poe21" n="21"/>
contents.  There had been nothing like order or arrangement.  Every
thing had been heaped in promiscuously.  Having assorted all with
care, we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we
had at first supposed.  In coin there was rather more than four
hundred and fifty thousand dollars—estimating the value of the
pieces, as accurately as we could, by the tables of the period.  There
was not a particle of silver.  All was gold of antique date and of
great variety—French, Spanish, and German money, with a few English
guineas, and some counters, of which we had never seen specimens
before.  There were several very large and heavy coins, so worn that
we could make nothing of their inscriptions.  There was no American
money.  The value of the jewels we found more difficulty in
estimating.  There were diamonds—some of them exceedingly large
and fine—a hundred and ten in all, and not one of them small;
eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy;—three hundred and ten
emeralds, all very beautiful; and twenty-one sapphires, with an opal.
These stones had all been broken from their settings and thrown
loose in the chest.  The settings themselves, which we picked out
from among the other gold, appeared to have been beaten up with
hammers, as if to prevent identification.  Besides all this, there
was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments;—nearly two hundred
massive finger and earrings;—rich chains—thirty of these, if I
remember;—eighty-three very large and heavy crucifixes;—five
gold censers of great value;—a prodigious golden punch bowl,
ornamented with richly chased vine-leaves and Bacchanalian figures;
with two sword-handles exquisitely embossed, and many other
smaller articles which I cannot recollect.  The weight of these
valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds <foreign lang="fre">avoirdupois</foreign>; and in
this estimate I have not included one hundred and ninety-seven
superb gold watches; three of the number being worth each five
hundred dollars, if one.  Many of them were very old, and as time
keepers valueless; the works having suffered, more or less, from
corrosion—but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth.
We estimated the entire contents of the chest, that night, at a
million and a half of dollars; and upon the subsequent disposal of the
trinkets and jewels (a
<pb id="poe22" n="22"/>
few being retained for our own use), it was found that we had greatly
undervalued the treasure.</p>
            <p>When, at length, we had concluded our examination, and the intense
excitement of the time had, in some measure, subsided, Legrand,
who saw that I was dying with impatience for a solution of this
most extraordinary riddle, entered into a full detail of all the
circumstances connected with it.</p>
            <p>“You remember;” said he, “the night when I handed you the rough
sketch I had made of the <hi rend="italics">scarabæus.</hi>  You recollect also, that I
became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a
death's-head.  When you first made this assertion I thought you were
jesting; but afterwards I called to mind the peculiar spots on the
back of the insect, and admitted to myself that your remark had some
little foundation in fact.  Still, the sneer at my graphic powers
irritated me—for I am considered a good artist—and, therefore,
when you handed me the scrap of parchment, I was about to crumple it up
and throw it angrily into the fire.”</p>
            <p>“The scrap of paper, you mean,” said I.</p>
            <p>“No; it had much of the appearance of paper, and at first I
supposed it to be such, but when I came to draw upon it, I discovered
it, at once, to be a piece of very thin parchment.  It was quite
dirty, you remember.  Well, as I was in the very act of crumpling it
up, my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking,
and you may imagine my astonishment when I perceived, in fact, the
figure of a death's-head just where, it seemed to me, I had made the
drawing of the beetle.  For a moment I was too much amazed to
think with accuracy.  I knew that my design was very different in
detail from this—although there was a certain similarity in general
outline.  Presently I took a candle, and seating myself at the other
end of the room, proceeded to scrutinize the parchment more closely.
Upon turning it over, I saw my own sketch upon the reverse, just as
I had made it.  My first idea, now, was mere surprise at the really
remarkable similarity of outline—at the singular coincidence
involved in the fact, that unknown to me, there should have been a
skull upon the other side of the parchment, immediately beneath
my figure of the <hi rend="italics">scarabæus</hi>, and that this skull, not only in outline,
but in size,
<pb id="poe23" n="23"/>
should so closely resemble my drawing.  I say the singularity of this
coincidence absolutely stupified me for a time.  This is the usual
effect of such coincidences.  The mind struggles to establish a
connexion—a sequence of cause and effect—and, being unable to do
so, suffers a species of temporary paralysis.  But, when I recovered
from this stupor, there dawned upon me gradually a conviction
which startled me even far more than the coincidence.  I began
distinctly, positively, to remember that there had been <hi rend="italics">no</hi> drawing
upon the parchment when I made my sketch of the<hi rend="italics"> scarabæus.</hi>  I became
perfectly certain of this; for I recollected turning up first one
side and then the other, in search of the cleanest spot.  Had the skull
been then there, of course I could not have failed to notice it.  Here
was indeed a mystery which I felt it impossible to explain; but, even
at that early moment, there seemed to glimmer, faintly, within the
most remote and secret chambers of my intellect, a glow-worm-like
conception of that truth which last night's adventure brought to so
magnificent a demonstration.  I arose at once, and putting the
parchment securely away, dismissed all farther reflection until I
should be alone.</p>
            <p>“When you had gone, and when Jupiter was fast asleep, I betook
myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair.  In the
first place I considered the manner in which the parchment had come
into my possession.  The spot where we discovered the <hi rend="italics">scarabaeus</hi>
was on the coast of the main land, about a mile eastward of the
island, and but a short distance above high water mark.  Upon my
taking hold of it, it gave me a sharp bite, which caused me to let it
drop.  Jupiter, with his accustomed caution, before seizing the
insect, which had flown towards him, looked about him for a leaf, or
something of that nature, by which to take hold of it.  It was at
this moment that his eyes, and mine also, fell upon the scrap of
parchment, which I then supposed to be paper.  It was lying half
buried in the sand, a corner sticking up.  Near the spot where we
found it, I observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to
have been a ship's long boat.  The wreck seemed to have been there
for a very great while; for the resemblance to boat timbers could
scarcely be traced.</p>
            <p>“Well, Jupiter picked up the parchment, wrapped the beetle
<pb id="poe24" n="24"/>
in it, and gave it to me.  Soon afterwards we turned to go home, and
on the way met Lieutenant G--.  I showed him the insect, and he begged
me to let him take it to the fort.  Upon my consenting, he thrust it
forthwith into his waistcoat pocket, without the parchment in which
it had been wrapped, and which I had continued to hold in my hand
during his inspection.  Perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind, and
thought it best to make sure of the prize at once—you know how
enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with Natural History.
At the same time, without being conscious of it, I must have
deposited the parchment in my own pocket.</p>
            <p>“You remember that when I went to the table, for the purpose of
making a sketch of the beetle, I found no paper where it was usually
kept.  I looked in the drawer, and found none there.  I searched my
pockets, hoping to find an old letter, when my hand fell upon the
parchment.  I thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my
possession; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force.</p>
            <p>“No doubt you will think me fanciful—but I had already established
a kind of <hi rend="italics">connexion</hi>.  I had put together two links of a great
chain.  There was a boat lying upon a sea-coast, and not far from the
boat was a parchment—<hi rend="italics">not a paper</hi>—with a skull depicted upon it.
You will, of course, ask ‘where is the connexion?’  I reply that the
skull, or death's-head, is the well-known emblem of the pirate.  The
flag of the death's head is hoisted in all engagements.</p>
            <p>“I have said that the scrap was parchment, and not paper.  Parchment
is durable—almost imperishable.  Matters of little moment
are rarely consigned to parchment; since, for the mere ordinary
purposes of drawing or writing, it is not nearly so well adapted as
paper.  This reflection suggested some meaning—some relevancy -
in the death's-head.  I did not fail to observe, also, the <hi rend="italics">form</hi>
of the parchment.  Although one of its corners had been, by some
accident, destroyed, it could be seen that the original form was
oblong.  It was just such a slip, indeed, as might have been chosen
for a memorandum—for a record of something to be long
remembered and carefully preserved.”</p>
            <p>“But,” I interposed, “you say that the skull was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> upon the
<pb id="poe25" n="25"/>
parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle.  How then do
you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull—since this
latter, according to your own admission, must have been designed
(God only knows how or by whom) at some period subsequent to
your sketching the <hi>scarabæus</hi>?”</p>
            <p>“Ah, hereupon turns the whole mystery; although the secret, at this
point, I had comparatively little difficulty in solving.  My steps
were sure, and could afford but a single result.  I reasoned, for
example, thus: When I drew the <hi>scarabæus</hi>, there was no skull
apparent upon the parchment.  When I had completed the drawing I
gave it to you, and observed you narrowly until you returned it.
<hi rend="italics">You</hi>, therefore, did not design the skull, and no one else was present
to do it.  Then it was not done by human agency.  And nevertheless
it was done.</p>
            <p>“At this stage of my reflections I endeavored to remember, and
<hi rend="italics">did</hi> remember, with entire distinctness, every incident which
occurred about the period in question.  The weather was chilly (oh
rare and happy accident!), and a fire was blazing upon the hearth.  I
was heated with exercise and sat near the table.  You, however, had
drawn a chair close to the chimney.  Just as I placed the parchment in
your hand, and as you were in the act of in. inspecting it, Wolf, the
Newfoundland, entered, and leaped upon your shoulders.  With your
left hand you caressed him and kept him off, while your right,
holding the parchment, was permitted to fall listlessly between your
knees, and in close proximity to the fire.  At one moment I thought
the blaze had caught it, and was about to caution you, but, before I
could speak, you had withdrawn it, and were engaged in its
examination.  When I considered all these particulars, I doubted not
for a moment that <hi rend="italics">heat</hi> had been the agent in bringing to light, upon
the parchment, the skull which I saw designed upon it.  You are well
aware that chemical preparations exist, and have existed time out of
mind, by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or
vellum, so that the characters shall become visible only when
subjected to the action of fire.  Zaffre, digested in <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">aqua regia</hi></foreign>, and
diluted with four times its weight of water, is sometimes employed;
a green tint results.  The regulus of cobalt, dissolved in spirit of
nitre, gives a red.  These colors disappear at longer or shorter
intervals after the material
<pb id="poe26" n="26"/>
written upon cools, but again become apparent upon the re-application
of heat.</p>
            <p>“I now scrutinized the death's-head with care.  Its outer edges—the
edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the vellum—were far more
<hi rend="italics">distinct</hi> than the others.  It was clear that the action of the caloric
had been imperfect or unequal.  I immediately kindled a fire, and
subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat.  At first,
the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull;
but, upon persevering in the experiment, there became visible, at
the corner of the slip, diagonally opposite to the spot in which the
death's-head was delineated, the figure of what I at first supposed to
be a goat.  A closer scrutiny, however, satisfied me that it was
intended for a kid.”</p>
            <p>“Ha! ha!” said I, “to be sure I have no right to laugh at you —a
million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth—but
you are not about to establish a third link in your chain—you will
not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a
goat—pirates, you know, have nothing to do with goats; they
appertain to the farming interest.”</p>
            <p>“But I have just said that the figure was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> that of a goat.”</p>
            <p>“Well, a kid then—pretty much the same thing.”</p>
            <p>“Pretty much, but not altogether,” said Legrand.  “You may have
heard of one <hi rend="italics">Captain</hi> Kidd.  I at once looked upon the figure of the
animal as a kind of punning or hieroglyphical signature.  I say
signature; because its position upon the vellum suggested this idea.
The death's-head at the corner diagonally opposite, had, in the same
manner, the air of a stamp, or seal.  But I was sorely put out by the
absence of all else—of the body to my imagined instrument—of
the text for my context.”</p>
            <p>“I presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp
and the signature.”</p>
            <p>“Something of that kind.  The fact is, I felt irresistibly impressed
with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending.  I
can scarcely say why.  Perhaps, after all, it was rather a desire
than an actual belief;—but do you know that Jupiter's silly words,
about the bug being of solid gold, had a remarkable effect upon my
fancy?  And then the series of accidents and coincidences—these
were so <hi rend="italics">very</hi> extraordinary.  Do you observe
<pb id="poe27" n="27"/>
how mere an accident it was that these events should have
occurred upon the <hi rend="italics">sole</hi> day of all the year in which it has been, or
may be, sufficiently cool for fire, and that without the fire, or
without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which
he appeared, I should never have become aware of the death's-head,
and so never the possessor of the treasure?”</p>
            <p>“But proceed—I am all impatience.”</p>
            <p>“Well; you have heard, of course, the many stories current—the
thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried, somewhere upon
the Atlantic coast, by Kidd and his associates.  These rumors must
have had some foundation in fact.  And that the rumors have existed
so long and so continuous, could have resulted, it appeared to me,
only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still <hi rend="italics">remaining</hi>
entombed.  Had Kidd concealed his plunder for a time, and afterwards
reclaimed it, the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their
present unvarying form.  You will observe that the stories told are
all about money-seekers, not about money-finders.  Had the pirate
recovered his money, there the affair would have dropped.  It seemed
to me that some accident—say the loss of a memorandum indicating
its locality—had deprived him of the means of recovering it, and
that this accident had become known to his followers, who
otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at
all, and who, busying themselves in vain, because unguided attempts,
to regain it, had given first birth, and then universal currency, to
the reports which are now so common.  Have you ever heard of any
important treasure being unearthed along the coast?”</p>
            <p>“Never.”</p>
            <p>“But that Kidd's accumulations were immense, is well known.  I took
it for granted, therefore, that the earth still held them; and you
will scarcely be surprised when I tell you that I felt a hope, nearly
amounting to certainty, that the parchment so strangely found,
involved a lost record of the place of deposit.”</p>
            <p>“But how did you proceed?”</p>
            <p>“I held the vellum again to the fire, after increasing the heat; but
nothing appeared.  I now thought it possible that the coating of dirt
might have something to do with the failure; so I carefully rinsed the
parchment by pouring warm water over it, and,
<pb id="poe28" n="28"/>
having done this, I placed it in a tin pan, with the skull downwards,
and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal.  In a few minutes,
the pan having become thoroughly heated, I removed the slip, and, to
my inexpressible joy, found it spotted, in several places, with what
appeared to be figures arranged in lines.  Again I placed it in the pan,
and suffered it to remain another minute.  Upon taking it off, the
whole was just as you see it now.”</p>
            <p>Here Legrand, having re-heated the parchment, submitted it to my
inspection.  The following characters were rudely traced, in a red
tint, between the death's-head and the goat:</p>

            <p>“But,” said I, returning him the slip, “I am as much in the dark as
ever.  Were all the jewels of Golconda awaiting me upon my solution
of this enigma, I am quite sure that I should be unable to earn them.”</p>
            <p>“And yet,” said Legrand, “the solution is by no means so difficult
as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection
of the characters.  These characters, as any one might readily guess,
form a cipher—that is to say, they convey a meaning; but then,
from what is known of Kidd, I could not suppose him capable of
constructing any of the more abstruse cryptographs.  I made up my
mind, at once, that this was of a simple species—such, however,
as would appear, to the crude intellect of the sailor, absolutely
insoluble without the key.”</p>
            <p>“And you really solved it?”</p>
            <p>“Readily; I have solved others of an abstruseness ten thousand
times greater.  Circumstances, and a certain bias of mind, have led me
to take interest in such riddles, and it may well be doubted whether
human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human
ingenuity may not, by proper application, resolve.  In fact, having
once established connected and legible characters, I scarcely gave a
thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import.</p>
            <pb id="poe29" n="29"/>
            <p>“In the present case—indeed in all cases of secret writing—the
first question regards the <hi rend="italics">language</hi> of the cipher; for the principles
of solution, so far, especially, as the more simple ciphers are
concerned, depend upon, and are varied by, the genius of the
particular idiom.  In general, there is no alternative but experiment
(directed by probabilities) of every tongue known to him who
attempts the solution, until the true one be attained.  But, with the
cipher now before us, all difficulty was removed by the signature.
The pun upon the word ‘Kidd’ is appreciable in no other language
than the English.  But for this consideration I should have begun
my attempts with the Spanish and French, as the tongues in which
a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a
pirate of the Spanish main.  As it was, I assumed the cryptograph to
be English.</p>
            <p>“You observe there are no divisions between the words.  Had
there been divisions, the task would have been comparatively easy.
In such case I should have commenced with a collation and analysis
of the shorter words, and, had a word of a single letter occurred, as
is most likely, (<hi rend="italics">a</hi> or <hi rend="italics">I</hi>, for example,) I should have considered the
solution as assured.  But, there being no division, my first step was
to ascertain the predominant letters, as well as the least frequent.
Counting all, I constructed a table, thus:</p>

            </p>
            <p>“Now, in English, the letter which most frequently occurs is
<pb id="poe30" n="30"/>
<hi rend="italics">e</hi>.  Afterwards, succession runs thus: <hi rend="italics">a o i d h n r s t u y c f g
l m w b k p q x z.</hi>
<hi rend="italics">E</hi> predominates so remarkably that an individual
sentence of any length is rarely seen, in which it is not the
prevailing character.</p>
            <p>“Here, then, we leave, in the very beginning, the groundwork for
something more than a mere guess.  The general use which may be
made of the table is obvious—but, in this particular cipher, we shall
only very partially require its aid.  As our predominant character is
8, we will commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet.
To verify the supposition, let us observe if the 8 be seen often in
couples—for e is doubled with great frequency in English—in such
words, for example, as ‘meet,’ ‘.fleet,’ ‘speed,’ ‘seen,’ been,’
‘agree,’ &amp;c.   In the present instance we see it doubled no less than five
times, although the cryptograph is brief.</p>
            <p>“Let us assume 8, then, as e.  Now, of all words in the language,
‘the’ is most usual; let us see, therefore, whether there are not
repetitions of any three characters, in the same order of collocation,
the last of them being 8.  If we discover repetitions of such letters, so
arranged, they will most probably represent the word ‘the.’  Upon
inspection, we find no less than seven such arrangements, the
characters being ;48.  We may, therefore, assume that ; represents <hi rend="italics">t</hi>,
4 represents <hi rend="italics">h</hi>, and 8 represents e—the last being now well
confirmed.  Thus a great step has been taken.</p>
            <p>“But, having established a single word, we are enabled to establish
a vastly important point; that is to say, several commencements
and terminations of other words.  Let us refer, for example, to the
last instance but one, in which the combination ;48 occurs—not
far from the end of the cipher.  We know that the ; immediately 
ensuing is the commencement of a word, and, of the six characters
succeeding this ‘the,’ we are cognizant of no less than five.  Let
us set these characters down, thus, by the letters we know
them to represent, leaving a space for the unknown —</p>
            <lg>
              <l> t eeth.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>“Here we are enabled, at once, to discard the ‘<hi rend="italics">th</hi>,’ as forming
no portion of the word commencing with the first <hi rend="italics">t</hi>; since, by
<pb id="poe31" n="31"/>
experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy,
we perceive that no word can be formed of which this <hi rend="italics">th</hi> can be a
part.  We are thus narrowed into</p>
            <lg>
              <l>t ee,</l>
            </lg>
            <p>and, going through the alphabet, if necessary, as before, we arrive
at the word ‘tree,’ as the sole possible reading.  We thus gain
another letter, <hi rend="italics">r</hi>, represented by (, with the words ‘the tree’ in
juxtaposition.</p>
            <p>“Looking beyond these words, for a short distance, we again see
the combination ;48, and employ it by way of <hi rend="italics">termination</hi> to what
immediately precedes.  We have thus this arrangement:</p>
            <lg>
              <l>the tree ;4(‡?34 the,</l>
            </lg>
            <p>or, substituting the natural letters, where known, it reads thus:</p>
            <lg>
              <l>the tree thr‡?3h the.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>“Now, if, in place of the unknown characters, we leave blank
spaces, or substitute dots, we read thus:</p>
            <lg>
              <l>the tree thr...h the,</l>
            </lg>
            <p>when the word ‘<hi rend="italics">through</hi>’ makes itself evident at once.  But this
discovery gives us three new letters, <hi rend="italics">o</hi>, <hi rend="italics">u</hi> and <hi rend="italics">g</hi>, represented by
‡ ? and 3.</p>
            <p>“Looking now, narrowly, through the cipher for combinations of
known characters, we find, not very far from the beginning, this
arrangement,</p>
            <lg>
              <l>83(88, or egree,</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which, plainly, is the conclusion of the word ‘degree,’ and gives
us another letter, <hi rend="italics">d</hi>, represented by †.</p>
            <p>“Four letters beyond the word ‘degree,’ we perceive the combination</p>
            <lg>
              <l>;48(;88.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>“Translating the known characters, and representing the unknown by
dots, as before, we read thus:</p>
            <lg>
              <l> th  rtee.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word ‘thirteen,’ and
again furnishing us with two new characters, <hi rend="italics">i</hi> and <hi rend="italics">n</hi>, represented by
6 and *.</p>
            <p>“Referring, now, to the beginning of the cryptograph, we find the
combination,</p>
            <lg>
              <l>53‡‡†.</l>
            </lg>
            <pb id="poe32" n="32"/>
            <p>“Translating, as before, we obtain</p>
            <lg>
              <l>. good,</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which assures us that the first letter is <hi rend="italics">A</hi>, and that the first two
words are ‘A good.’</p>
            <p>“It is now time that we arrange our key, as far as discovered, in
a tabular form, to avoid confusion.  It will stand thus:</p>

            <p>“We have, therefore, no less than ten of the most important
letters represented, and it will be unnecessary to proceed with the
details of the solution.  I have said enough to convince you that
ciphers of this nature are readily soluble, and to give you some
insight into the <hi rend="italics">rationale</hi> of their development.  But be assured that
the specimen before us appertains to the very simplest species of
cryptograph.  It now only remains to give you the full translation
of the characters upon the parchment, as unriddled.  Here it is:</p>
            <p><hi rend="italics">‘A good glass in the bishop's hostel in the devil's seat forty-one
degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch
seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the death's-head
a bee line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out.’</hi> ”</p>
            <p>“But,” said I, “the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as
ever.  How is it possible to extort a meaning from all this jargon
about ‘devil's seats,’ ‘death's heads,’ and ‘bishop's hotels?’ ”</p>
            <p>“I confess,” replied Legrand, “that the matter still wears a
serious aspect, when regarded with a casual glance.  My first
endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division
intended by the cryptographist.”</p>
            <p>“You mean, to punctuate it?”</p>
            <p>“Something of that kind.”</p>
            <pb id="poe33" n="33"/>
            <p>“But how was it possible to effect this?”</p>
            <p>“I reflected that it had been a <hi rend="italics">point</hi> with the writer to run his
words together without division, so as to increase the difficulty of
solution.  Now, a not over-acute man, in pursuing such an object
would be nearly certain to overdo the matter.  When, in the course
of his composition, he arrived at a break in his subject which would
naturally require a pause, or a point, he would be exceedingly apt to
run his characters, at this place, more than usually close together.
If you will observe the MS., in the present instance, you will easily
detect five such cases of unusual crowding.  Acting upon this hint, I
made the division thus:</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="italics">‘A good glass in the Bishop's hostel in the Devil's seat—forty-one
degrees and thirteen minutes—northeast and by north—main
branch seventh limb east side—shoot from the left eye of the
death's-head—a bee-line from the tree through the shot fifty feet
out.’ ”</hi>
            </p>
            <p>“Even this division,” said I, “leaves me still in the dark.”</p>
            <p>“It left me also in the dark,” replied Legrand, “for a few days;
during which I made diligent inquiry, in the neighborhood of
Sullivan's Island, for any building which went by the name of the 
‘Bishop's Hotel;’ for, of course, I dropped the obsolete word
‘hostel.’  Gaining no information on the subject, I was on the point
of extending my sphere of search, and proceeding in a more
systematic manner, when, one morning, it entered into my head,
quite suddenly, that this ‘Bishop's Hostel’ might have some
reference to an old family, of the name of Bessop, which, time out of
mind, had held possession of an ancient manor-house, about four
miles to the northward of the Island.  I accordingly went over to the
plantation, and re-instituted my inquiries among the older negroes of
the place.  At length one of the most aged of the women said that she
had heard of such a place as <hi rend="italics">Bessop's Castle</hi>, and thought that she
could guide me to it, but that it was not a castle nor a tavern, but a
high rock.</p>
            <p>“I offered to pay her well for her trouble, and, after some demur,
she consented to accompany me to the spot.  We found it without
much difficulty, when, dismissing her, I proceeded to examine
the place.  The ‘castle’ consisted of an irregular assemblage
of cliffs and rocks—one of the latter being quite remarkable
<pb id="poe34" n="34"/>
for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance
I clambered to its apex, and then felt much at a loss as to what
should be next done.</p>
            <p>“While I was busied in reflection, my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge
in the eastern face of the rock, perhaps a yard below the summit
upon which I stood.  This ledge projected about eighteen inches,
and was not more than a foot wide, while a niche in the cliff just
above it, gave it a rude resemblance to one of the hollow-backed
chairs used by our ancestors.  I made no doubt that here was the
‘devil's seat’ alluded to in the MS., and now I seemed to grasp the
full secret of the riddle.</p>
            <p>“The ‘good glass,’ I knew, could have reference to nothing but a
telescope; for the word ‘glass’ is rarely employed in any other sense
by seamen.  Now here, I at once saw, was a telescope to be used,
and a definite point of view, <hi rend="italics">admitting no variation</hi>, from which to
use it.  Nor did I hesitate to believe that the phrases, <sic>“</sic>forty-one
degrees and thirteen minutes,‘ and ‘northeast and by north,’ were
intended as directions for the levelling of the glass.  Greatly excited
by these discoveries, I hurried home, procured a telescope, and
returned to the rock.</p>
            <p>“I let myself down to the ledge, and found that it was impossible
to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position.  This
fact confirmed my preconceived idea.  I proceeded to use the glass.
Of course, the ‘forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes’ could allude
to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon, since the
horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words, ‘northeast
and by north.’  This latter direction I at once established by means of
a pocket-compass; then, pointing the glass as nearly at an angle of
forty-one degrees of elevation as I could do it by guess, I moved it
cautiously up or down, until my attention was arrested by a circular
rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that overtopped its
fellows in the distance.  In the centre of this rift I perceived a
white spot, but could not, at first, distinguish what it was.
Adjusting the focus of the telescope, I again looked, and now made
it out to be a human skull.</p>
            <p>“Upon this discovery I was so sanguine as to consider the
enigma solved; for the phrase ‘main branch, seventh limb, east
side,’ could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree,
<pb id="poe35" n="35"/>
while ‘shoot from the left eye of the death's head’ admitted, also, of
but one interpretation, in regard to a search for buried treasure.  I
perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of
the skull, and that a bee-line, or, in other words, a straight line,
drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through ‘the shot,’ (or
the spot where the bullet fell,) and thence extended to a distance of
fifty feet, would indicate a definite point—and beneath this point I
thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed.”</p>
            <p>“All this,” I said, “is exceedingly clear, and, although ingenious,
still simple and explicit.  When you left the Bishop's Hotel, what
then?”</p>
            <p>“Why, having carefully taken the bearings of the tree, I turned
homewards.  The instant that I left ‘the devil's seat,’ however, the
circular rift vanished; nor could I get a glimpse of it afterwards,
turn as I would.  What seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole
business, is the fact (for repeated experiment has convinced me it is
a fact) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other
attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge
upon the face of the rock.</p>
            <p>“In this expedition to the ‘Bishop's Hotel’ I had been attended by
Jupiter, who had, no doubt, observed, for some weeks past, the
abstraction of my demeanor, and took especial care not to leave me
alone.  But, on the next day, getting up very early, I contrived to
give him the slip, and went into the hills in search of the tree.
After much toil I found it.  When I came home at night my valet
proposed to give me a flogging.  With the rest of the adventure I
believe you are as well acquainted as myself.”</p>
            <p>“I suppose,” said I, “you missed the spot, in the first attempt
at digging, through Jupiter's stupidity in letting the bug fall
through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull.”</p>
            <p>“Precisely.  This mistake made a difference of about two inches
and a half in the ‘shot’—that is to say, in the position of the peg
nearest the tree; and had the treasure been <hi rend="italics">beneath</hi> the ‘shot,’ the
error would have been of little moment; but ‘the shot,’ together
with the nearest point of the tree, were merely two points for the
establishment of a line of direction; of course the error, however
trivial in the beginning, increased as we proceeded
<pb id="poe36" n="36"/>
with the line, and by the time we had gone fifty feet, threw us quite
off the scent.  But for my deep-seated impressions that treasure was
here somewhere actually buried, we might have had all our labor in vain.”</p>
            <p>“But your grandiloquence, and your conduct in swinging the
beetle—how excessively odd!  I was sure you were mad.  And why
did you insist upon letting fall the bug, instead of a bullet, from the
skull?”</p>
            <p>“Why, to be frank, I felt somewhat annoyed by your evident
suspicions touching my sanity, and so resolved to punish you
quietly, in my own way, by a little bit of sober mystification.  For
this reason I swung the beetle, and for this reason I let it fall it from
the tree.  An observation of yours about its great weight suggested
the latter idea.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I perceive; and now there is only one point which puzzles
me.  What are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole?”</p>
            <p>“That is a question I am no more able to answer than yourself.
There seems, however, only one plausible way of accounting for
them—and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my
suggestion would imply.  It is clear that Kidd—if Kidd indeed
secreted this treasure, which I doubt not—it is clear that he must
have had assistance in the labor.  But this labor concluded, he may
have thought it expedient to remove all participants in his secret.
Perhaps a couple of blows with a mattock were sufficient, while his
coadjutors were busy in the pit; perhaps it required a dozen—who
shall tell?”</p>

          <head>THE BLACK CAT.</head>
          <p>FOR the most wild, yet most homely narrative which I am about
to pen, I neither expect nor solicit belief.  Mad indeed would I be to
expect it, in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence.
Yet, mad am I not —and very surely do I not dream.  But to-morrow
I die, and to-day I would unburthen my soul.  My immediate
purpose is to place before the world, plainly, succinctly, and
without comment, a series of mere household events.  In their
consequences, these events have terrified—have tortured—have
destroyed me.  Yet I will not attempt to expound them.  To me, they
have presented little but Horror—to many they will seem less
terrible than <hi rend="italics">barroques</hi>.  Hereafter, perhaps, some intellect may be
found which will reduce my phantasm to the common-place—some
intellect more calm, more logical, and far less excitable than my own,
which will perceive, in the circumstances I detail with awe, nothing
more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects.</p>
          <p>From my infancy I was noted for the docility and humanity of
my disposition.  My tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as
to make me the jest of my companions.  I was especially fond of
animals, and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of
pets.  With these I spent most of my time, and never was so happy
as when feeding and caressing them.  This peculiarity of character grew
with my growth, and in my manhood, I derived from it one of my
principal sources of pleasure.  To those who have cherished an affection
for a faithful and sagacious dog, I need hardly be at the trouble of
explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus derivable.
There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute,
which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion
to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere <hi rend="italics">Man</hi>.</p>
          <pb id="poe38" n="38"/>
          <p>I married early, and was happy to find in my wife a disposition
not uncongenial with my own.  Observing my partiality for domestic pets,
she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable
kind.  We had birds, gold-fish, a fine dog, rabbits, a small monkey,
and <hi rend="italics">a cat</hi>.</p>
          <p>This latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal, entirely
black, and sagacious to an astonishing degree.  In speaking of his
intelligence, my wife, who at heart was not a little tinctured with
superstition, made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion,
which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise.  Not that she
was ever <hi rend="italics">serious</hi> upon this point—and I mention the matter at all for
no better reason than that it happens, just now, to be remembered.</p>
          <p>Pluto—this was the cat's name—was my favorite pet and
playmate.  I alone fed him, and he attended me wherever I went
about the house.  It was even with difficulty that I could prevent him
from following me through the streets.</p>
          <p>Our friendship lasted, in this manner, for several years, during
which my general temperament and character—through the
instrumentality of the Fiend Intemperance—had (I blush to confess
it) experienced a radical alteration for the worse.  I grew, day by day,
more moody, more irritable, more regardless of the feelings of
others.  I suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife.  At
length, I even offered her personal violence.  My pets, of course, were
made to feel the change in my disposition.  I not only neglected, but
ill-used them.  For Pluto, however, I still retained sufficient regard to
restrain me from maltreating him, as I made no scruple of maltreating
the rabbits, the monkey, or even the dog, when by accident, or
through affection, they came in my way.  But my disease grew upon
me—for what disease is like Alcohol!—and at length even Pluto,
who was now becoming old, and consequently somewhat
peevish—even Pluto began to experience the effects of my ill
temper.</p>
          <p>One night, returning home, much intoxicated, from one of my
haunts about town, I fancied that the cat avoided my presence.  I
seized him; when, in his fright at my violence, he inflicted a slight
wound upon my hand with his teeth.  The fury of a demon
instantly possessed me.  I knew myself no longer.  My
<pb id="poe39" n="39"/>
original soul seemed, at once, to take its flight from my body and a
more than fiendish malevolence, gin-nurtured, thrilled every fibre of
my frame.  I took from my waistcoat-pocket a pen-knife, opened it,
grasped the poor beast by the throat, and deliberately cut one of its
eyes from the socket!  I blush, I burn, I shudder, while I pen the
damnable atrocity.</p>
          <p>When reason returned with the morning—when I had slept off
the fumes of the night's debauch—I experienced a sentiment half of
horror, half of remorse, for the crime of which I had been guilty; but
it was, at best, a feeble and equivocal feeling, and the soul remained
untouched.  I again plunged into excess, and soon drowned in wine
all memory of the deed.</p>
          <p>In the meantime the cat slowly recovered.  The socket of the lost
eye presented, it is true, a frightful appearance, but he no longer
appeared to suffer any pain.  He went about the house as usual, but,
as might be expected, fled in extreme terror at my approach.  I had so
much of my old heart left, as to be at first grieved by this evident
dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me.  But this
feeling soon gave place to irritation.  And then came, as if to my final
and irrevocable overthrow, the spirit of PERVERSENESS.  Of this
spirit philosophy takes no account.  Yet I am not more sure that my
soul lives, than I am that perverseness is one of the primitive
impulses of the human heart—one of the indivisible primary
faculties, or sentiments, which give direction to the character of
Man.  Who has not, a hundred times, found himself committing a vile
or a silly action, for no other reason than because he knows he
should <hi rend="italics">not</hi>?  Have we not a perpetual inclination, in the teeth of our
best judgment, to violate that which is <hi rend="italics">Law</hi>, merely because we
understand it to be such?  This spirit of perverseness, I say, came to
my final overthrow.  It was this unfathomable longing of the soul <hi rend="italics">to
vex itself</hi>—to offer violence to its own nature—to do wrong for the
wrong's sake only—that urged me to continue and finally to
consummate the injury I had inflicted upon the unoffending brute.
One morning, in cool blood, I slipped a noose about its neck and
hung it to the limb of a tree;—hung it with the tears streaming from
my eyes, and with the bitterest remorse at my heart;—hung it
<hi rend="italics">because</hi> I knew that it had loved me, and <hi rend="italics">because</hi>
<pb id="poe40" n="40"/>
I felt it had given me no reason of offence;—hung it <hi rend="italics">because</hi> I knew that in so doing I was committing a sin—a deadly sin that
would so jeopardize my immortal soul as to place it—if such a
thing wore possible—even beyond the reach of the infinite mercy of
the Most Merciful and Most Terrible God.</p>
          <p>On the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done, I was
aroused from sleep by the cry of fire.  The curtains of my bed were
in flames.  The whole house was blazing.  It was with great difficulty
that my wife, a servant, and myself, made our escape from the
conflagration.  The destruction was complete.  My entire worldly
wealth was swallowed up, and I resigned myself thenceforward to
despair.</p>
          <p>I am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of
cause and effect, between the disaster and the atrocity.  But I am
detailing a chain of facts—and wish not to leave even a possible link
imperfect.  On the day succeeding the fire, I visited the ruins.  The
walls, with one exception, had fallen in.  This exception was found
in a compartment wall, not very thick, which stood about the middle
of the house, and against which had rested the head of my bed.  The
plastering had here, in great measure, resisted the action of the
fire—a fact which I attributed to its having been recently spread.
About this wall a dense crowd were collected, and many persons
seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute
and eager attention.  The words “strange!” “singular!” and other
similar expressions, excited my curiosity.  I approached and saw, as
if graven in <hi rend="italics">bas relief</hi> upon the white surface, the figure of a gigantic
<hi rend="italics">cat</hi>.  The impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous.
There was a rope about the animal's neck.</p>
          <p>When I first beheld this apparition—for I could scarcely regard
it as less—my wonder and my terror were extreme.  But at length
reflection came to my aid.  The cat, I remembered, had been hung in a
garden adjacent to the house.  Upon the alarm of fire, this garden
had been immediately filled by the crowd—by some one of whom
the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown, through an
open window, into my chamber.  This had probably been done with
the view of arousing me from sleep.  The falling of other walls had
compressed the victim of my cruelty
<pb id="poe41" n="41"/>
into the substance of the freshly-spread plaster; the lime of
which, with the flames, and the <hi rend="italics">ammonia</hi> from the carcass, had then
accomplished the portraiture as I saw it.</p>
          <p>Although I thus readily accounted to my reason, if not altogether
to my conscience, for the startling fact just detailed, it did not the
less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy.  For months I
could not rid myself of the phantasm of the cat; and, during this
period, there came back into my spirit a half-sentiment that
seemed, but was not, remorse.  I went so far as to regret the loss of
the animal, and to look about me, among the vile haunts which I now
habitually frequented, for another pet of the same species, and of
somewhat similar appearance, with which to supply its place.</p>
          <p>One night as I sat, half stupified, in a den of more than infamy,
my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object, reposing
upon the head of one of the immense hogsheads of Gin, or of Rum,
which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment.  I had been
looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes, and
what now caused me surprise was the fact that I had not sooner
perceived the object thereupon.  I approached it, and touched it with
my hand.  It was a black cat—a very large one—fully as large as
Pluto, and closely resembling him in every respect but one.  Pluto
had not a white hair upon any portion of his body; but this cat had a
large, although indefinite splotch of white, covering nearly the whole
region of the breast.</p>
          <p>Upon my touching him, he immediately arose, purred loudly,
rubbed against my hand, and appeared delighted with my notice.
This, then, was the very creature of which I was in search.  I at once
offered to purchase it of the landlord; but this person made no
claim to it—knew nothing of it—had never seen it before.</p>
          <p>I continued my caresses, and, when I prepared to go home, the
animal evinced a disposition to accompany me.  I permitted it to do
so; occasionally stooping and patting it as I proceeded.  When it
reached the house it domesticated itself at once, and became
immediately a great favorite with my wife.</p>
          <p>For my own part, I soon found a dislike to it arising within me.
This was just the reverse of what I had anticipated; but—
<pb id="poe42" n="42"/>
I know not how or why it was—its evident fondness for myself
rather disgusted and annoyed.  By slow degrees, these feelings of
disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred.  I avoided
the creature; a certain sense of shame, and the remembrance of my former
deed of cruelty, preventing me from physically abusing it.  I did
not, for some weeks, strike, or otherwise violently ill use it; but
gradually—very gradually—I came to look upon it with unutterable
loathing, and to flee silently from its odious presence, as from the
breath of a pestilence.</p>
          <p>What added, no doubt, to my hatred of the beast, was the discovery,
on the morning after I brought it home, that, like Pluto, it
also had been deprived of one of its eyes.  This circumstance,
however, only endeared it to my wife, who, as I have already said,
possessed, in a high degree, that humanity of feeling which had once
been my distinguishing trait, and the source of many of my simplest
and purest pleasures.</p>
          <p>With my aversion to this cat, however, its partiality for myself
seemed to increase.  It followed my footsteps with a pertinacity
which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend.
Whenever I sat, it would crouch beneath my chair, or spring upon
my knees, covering me with its loathsome caresses.  If I arose to walk
it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down, or,
fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress, clamber, in this
manner, to my breast.  At such times, although I longed to destroy it
with a blow, I was yet withheld from so doing, partly by a memory
of my former crime, but chiefly—let me confess it at once—by
absolute <hi rend="italics">dread</hi> of the beast.</p>
          <p>This dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil—and yet I
should be at a loss how otherwise to define it.  I am almost ashamed
to own—yes, even in this felon's cell, I am almost ashamed to
own—that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired
me, had been heightened by one of the merest chimaeras it would
be possible to conceive.  My wife had called my attention, more than
once, to the character of the mark of white hair, of which I have
spoken, and which constituted the sole visible difference between
the strange beast and the one I had destroyed.  The reader will
remember that this mark, although large, had been originally very
indefinite; but, by slow degrees—
<pb id="poe43" n="43"/>
degrees nearly imperceptible, and which for a long time my Reason
struggled to reject as fanciful—it had, at length, assumed a
rigorous distinctness of outline.  It was now the representation of an
object that I shudder to name—and for this, above all, I loathed,
and dreaded, and would have rid myself of the monster <hi>had</hi> I <hi rend="italics">dared</hi> —it was now, I say, the image of a hideous—of a ghastly thing—of
the GALLOWS!—oh, mournful and terrible engine of Horror and of
Crime—of Agony and of Death!</p>
          <p>And now was I indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere
Humanity.  And <hi rend="italics">a brute beast</hi>—whose fellow I had contemptuously
destroyed—<hi rend="italics">a brute beast</hi> to work out for <hi rend="italics">me</hi>—for me a man,
fashioned in the image of the High God—so much of insufferable wo!
Alas! neither by day nor by night knew I the blessing of Rest any more!
During the former the creature left me no moment alone; and, in the
latter, I started, hourly, from dreams of unutterable fear, to find the
hot breath of <hi rend="italics">the thing</hi> upon my face, and its vast weight—an
incarnate Night-Mare that I had no power to shake off—incumbent
eternally upon my <hi rend="italics">heart</hi>!</p>
          <p>Beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant
of the good within me succumbed.  Evil thoughts became my sole
intimates—the darkest and most evil of thoughts.  The moodiness
of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all
mankind; while, from the sudden, frequent, and ungovernable
outbursts of a fury to which I now blindly abandoned myself, my
uncomplaining wife, alas! was the most usual and the most patient
of sufferers.</p>
          <p>One day she accompanied me, upon some household errand, into
the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to
inhabit.  The cat followed me down the steep stairs, and, nearly
throwing me headlong, exasperated me to madness.  Uplifting an axe,
and forgetting, in my wrath, the childish dread which had hitherto
stayed my hand, I aimed a blow at the animal which, of course,
would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as I wished.
But this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife.  Goaded, by the
interference, into a rage more than demoniacal, I withdrew my arm
from her grasp and buried the axe in her brain.  She fell dead upon
the spot, without a groan.</p>
          <p>This hideous murder accomplished, I set myself forthwith, and
<pb id="poe44" n="44"/>
with entire deliberation, to the task of concealing the body.  I knew
that I could not remove it from the house, either by day or by night,
without the risk of being observed by the neighbors.  Many projects
entered my mind.  At one period I thought of cutting the corpse into minute
fragments, and destroying them by fire.  At another, I resolved to dig
a grave for it in the floor of the cellar.  Again, I deliberated about
casting it in the well in the yard—about packing it in a box, as if
merchandize, with the usual arrangements, and so getting a porter to
take it from the house.  Finally I hit upon what I considered a far
better expedient than either of these.  I determined to wall it up in
the cellar—as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have
walled up their victims.</p>
          <p>For a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted.  Its walls
were loosely constructed, and had lately been plastered throughout
with a rough plaster, which the dampness of the atmosphere had
prevented from hardening.  Moreover, in one of the walls was a
projection, caused by a false chimney, or fireplace, that had been
filled up, and made to resemble the red of the cellar.  I made no
doubt that I could readily displace the bricks at this point, insert the
corpse, and wall the whole up as before, so that no eye could detect
any thing suspicious.</p>
          <p>And in this calculation I was not deceived.  By means of a crow-bar
I easily dislodged the bricks, and, having carefully deposited the
body against the inner wall, I propped it in that position, while,
with little trouble, I re-laid the whole structure as it originally
stood.  Having procured mortar, sand, and hair, with every possible
precaution, I prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished
from the old, and with this I very carefully went over the new
brickwork.  When I had finished, I felt satisfied that all was right.
The wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been
disturbed.  The rubbish on the floor was picked up with the
minutest care.  I looked around triumphantly, and said to
myself—“Here at least, then, my labor has not been in vain.”</p>
          <p>My next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause
of so much wretchedness; for I had, at length, firmly resolved to
put it to death.  Had I been able to meet with it, at the
<pb id="poe45" n="45"/>
moment, there could have been no doubt of its fate; but it appeared
that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my
previous anger, and forebore to present itself in my present mood.
It is impossible to describe, or to imagine, the deep, the blissful
sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned
in my bosom.  It did not make its appearance during the night—and
thus for one night at least, since its introduction into the house, I
soundly and tranquilly slept; aye, <hi rend="italics">slept</hi> even with the burden of
murder upon my soul!</p>
          <p>The second and the third day passed, and still my tormentor
came not.  Once again I breathed as a freeman.  The monster, in
terror, had fled the premises forever!  I should behold it no more!
My happiness was supreme!  The guilt of my dark deed disturbed
me but little.  Some few inquiries had been made, but these had been
readily answered.  Even a search had been instituted—but of course
nothing was to be discovered.  I looked upon my future felicity as
secured.</p>
          <p>Upon the fourth day of the assassination, a party of the police
came, very unexpectedly, into the house, and proceeded again to
make rigorous investigation of the premises.  Secure, however, in
the inscrutability of my place of concealment, I felt no
embarrassment whatever.  The officers bade me accompany them in
their search.  They left no nook or corner unexplored.  At length, for
the third or fourth time, they descended into the cellar.  I quivered
not in a muscle.  My heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers
in innocence.  I walked the cellar from end to end.  I folded my arms
upon my bosom, and roamed easily to and fro.  The police were
thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart.  The glee at my heart
was too strong to be restrained.  I burned to say if but one word, by
way of triumph, and to render doubly sure their assurance of my
guiltlessness.</p>
          <p>“Gentlemen,” I said at last, as the party ascended the steps, “I
delight to have allayed your suspicions.  I wish you all health, and
a little more courtesy.  By the bye, gentlemen, this—this is a very
well constructed house.”  [In the rabid desire to say something
easily, I scarcely knew what I uttered at all.]—“I may say an
<hi rend="italics">excellently</hi> well constructed house.  These walls are you going,
gentlemen?—these walls are solidly put together;”
<pb id="poe46" n="46"/>
and here, through the mere phrenzy of bravado, I rapped
heavily, with a cane which I held in my hand, upon that very
portion of the brick-work behind which stood the corpse of the wife
of my bosom.</p>
          <p>But may God shield and deliver me from the fangs of the
Arch-Fiend !  No sooner had the reverberation of my blows sunk
into silence, than I was answered by a voice from within the tomb!—by a cry, at first muffled and broken, like the sobbing of a child,
and then quickly swelling into one long, loud, and continuous
scream, utterly anomalous and inhuman—a howl—a wailing shriek,
half of horror and half of triumph, such as might have arisen only
out of hell, conjointly from the throats of the dammed in their agony
and of the demons that exult in the damnation.</p>
          <p>Of my own thoughts it is folly to speak.  Swooning, I staggered to
the opposite wall.  For one instant the party upon the stairs remained
motionless, through extremity of terror and of awe.  In the next, a
dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall.  It fell bodily.  The
corpse, already greatly decayed and clotted with gore, stood erect
before the eyes of the spectators.  Upon its head, with red extended
mouth and solitary eye of fire, sat the hideous beast whose craft
had seduced me into murder, and whose informing voice had
consigned me to the hangman.  I had walled the monster up within
the tomb!</p>

          <head>MESMERIC REVELATION.</head>
          <p>WHATEVER doubt may still envelop the <hi rend="italics">rationale</hi> of mesmerism, its
startling <hi rend="italics">facts</hi> are now almost universally admitted.  Of these latter,
those who doubt, are your mere doubters by profession—an
unprofitable and disreputable tribe.  There can be no more absolute
waste of time than the attempt to <hi rend="italics">prove</hi>, at the present day, that
man, by mere exercise of will, can so impress his fellow, as to cast
him into an abnormal condition, of which the phenomena resemble
very closely those of <hi rend="italics">death</hi>, or at least resemble them more nearly
than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within
our cognizance; that, while in this state, the person so impressed
employs only with effort, and then feebly, the external organs of
sense, yet perceives, with keenly refined perception, and through
channels supposed unknown, matters beyond the scope of the
physical organs; that, moreover, his intellectual faculties are
wonderfully exalted and invigorated; that his sympathies with the
person so impressing him are profound; and, finally, that his
susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency,
while, in the same proportion, the peculiar phenomena elicited are
more extended and more <hi rend="italics">pronounced</hi>.</p>
          <p>I say that these—which are the laws of mesmerism in its general
features—it would be supererogation to demonstrate; nor shall I
inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration to-day.  My
purpose at present is a very different one indeed.  I am impelled,
even in the teeth of a world of prejudice, to detail without comment
the very remarkable substance of a colloquy, occurring between
a sleep-waker and myself.</p>
          <p>I had been long in the habit of mesmerizing the person in
<pb id="poe48" n="48"/>
question, (Mr. Vankirk,) and the usual acute susceptibility and
exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened.  For many
months he had been laboring under confirmed phthisis, the more
distressing effects of which had been relieved by my manipulations;
and on the night of Wednesday, the fifteenth instant, I was
summoned to his bedside.</p>
          <p>The invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the
heart, and breathed with great difficulty, having all the ordinary
symptoms of asthma.  In spasms such as these he had usually found
relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres, but
tonight this had been attempted in vain.</p>
          <p>As I entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile, and
although evidently in much bodily pain, appeared to be, mentally,
quite at ease.</p>
          <p>“I sent for you to-night,” he said, “not so much to administer to
my bodily ailment, as to satisfy me concerning certain psychal
impressions which, of late, have occasioned me much anxiety and
surprise.  I need not tell you how sceptical I have hitherto been on
the topic of the soul's immortality.  I cannot deny that there has
always existed, as if in that very soul which I have been denying, a
vague half-sentiment of its own existence.  But this half-sentiment at
no time amounted to conviction.  With it my reason had nothing to
do.  All attempts at logical inquiry resulted, indeed, in leaving me
more sceptical than before.  I had been advised to study Cousin.  I
studied him in his own works as well as in those of his European
and American echoes.  The ‘Charles Elwood’ of Mr. Brownson, for
example, was placed in my hands.  I read it with profound attention.
Throughout I found it logical, but the portions which were not <hi rend="italics">merely</hi>
logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the disbelieving hero
of the book.  In his summing up it seemed evident to me that the
reasoner had not even succeeded in convincing himself.  His end had
plainly forgotten his beginning, like the government of Trinculo.  In
short, I was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually
convinced of his own immortality, he will never be so convinced
by the mere abstractions which have been so long the fashion of the
moralists of England, of France, and of Germany.  Abstractions
may amuse and exercise, but take no hold
<pb id="poe49" n="49"/>
on the mind.  Here upon earth, at least, philosophy, I am persuaded,
will always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things.
The will may assent—the soul—the intellect, never.</p>
          <p>“I repeat, then, that I only half felt, and never intellectually
believed.  But latterly there has been a certain deepening of the
feeling, until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of
reason, that I find it difficult to distinguish between the two.  I am
enabled, too, plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence.
I cannot better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that
the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of
ratiocination which, in my abnormal existence, convinces, but
which, in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena, does not
extend, except through its <hi rend="italics">effect</hi>, into my normal condition.  In
sleep-walking, the reasoning and its conclusion—the cause and its
effect—are present together.  In my natural state, the cause
vanishing, the effect only, and perhaps only partially, remains.</p>
          <p>“These considerations have led me to think that some good results
might ensue from a series of well directed questions propounded to
me while mesmerized.  You have often observed the profound
self-cognizance evinced by the sleep-waker—the extensive knowledge he
displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself;
and from this self-cognizance may be deduced hints for the proper
conduct of a catechism.”</p>
          <p>I consented of course to make this experiment.  A few passes
threw Mr. Vankirk into the mesmeric sleep.  His breathing became
immediately more easy, and he seemed to suffer no physical
uneasiness.  The following conversation then ensued:—V. in the
dialogue representing the patient, and P. myself.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Are you asleep?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes—no; I would rather sleep more soundly.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">After a few more passes.</hi>]  Do you sleep now?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> How do you think your present illness will result?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">After a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort.</hi>]  I must die.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Does the idea of death afflict you?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">Very quickly.</hi>]  No—no!</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Are you pleased with the prospect?</p>
          <pb id="poe50" n="50"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> If I were awake I should like to die, but now it is no matter.
The mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> I wish you would explain yourself, Mr. Vankirk.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> I am willing to do so, but it requires more effort than I feel
able to make.  You do not question me properly.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> What then shall I ask?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> You must begin at the beginning.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> The beginning! but where is the beginning?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> You know that the beginning is GOD.  [<hi rend="italics">This was said in a
low, fluctuating tone, and with every sign of the most profound
veneration.</hi>]</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> What then is God?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">Hesitating for many minutes.</hi>]  I cannot tell.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Is not God spirit?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> While I was awake I knew what you meant by “spirit,” but now
it seems only a word—such for instance as truth, beauty—a
quality, I mean.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Is not God immaterial?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> There is no immateriality—it is a mere word.  That which is
not matter, is not at all—unless qualities are things.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Is God, then, material?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> No. [<hi rend="italics">This reply startled me very much.</hi>]</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> What then is he?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">After a long pause, and mutteringly.</hi>]  I see—but it is a thing
difficult to tell.  [<hi rend="italics">Another long pause.</hi>]  He is not spirit, for he exists.
Nor is he matter, <hi rend="italics">as you underhand it.</hi>  But there are <hi rend="italics">gradations</hi> of
matter of which man knows nothing; the grosser impelling the finer,
the finer pervading the grosser.  The atmosphere, for example,
impels the electric principle, while the electric principle permeates
the atmosphere.  These gradations of matter increase in rarity or
fineness, until we arrive at a matter <hi rend="italics">unparticled</hi> without
particles—indivisible—<hi rend="italics">one</hi>; and here the law of impulsion and
permeation is modified.  The ultimate, or unparticled matter, not
only permeates all things but impels all things and thus <hi rend="italics">is</hi> all
things within itself.  This matter is God.  What men attempt to
embody in the word “thought,” is this matter in motion.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> The metaphysicians maintain that all notion is reducible
<pb id="poe51" n="51"/>
to motion and thinking, and that the latter is the origin of the
former.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes; and I now see the confusion of idea.  Motion is the action
of <hi rend="italics">mind</hi>—not of <hi rend="italics">thinking.</hi> The unparticled matter, or God, in
quiescence, is (as nearly as we can conceive it) what men call mind.
And the power of self-movement (equivalent in effect to human
volition) is, in the unparticled matter, the result of its unity and
omniprevalence; <hi rend="italics">how</hi> I know not, and now clearly see that I shall
never know.  But the unparticled matter, set in motion by a law, or
quality, existing within itself, is thinking.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the
unparticled matter?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> The matters of which man is cognizant, escape the senses in
gradation.  We have, for example, a metal, a piece of wood, a drop of
water, the atmosphere, a gas, caloric, electricity, the luminiferous
ether.  Now we call all these things matter, and embrace all matter in
one general definition; but in spite of this, there can be no two ideas
more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal, and
that which we attach to the luminiferous ether.  When we reach the
latter, we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit,
or with nihility.  The only consideration which restrains us is our
conception of its atomic constitution; and here, even, we have to
seek aid from our notion of an atom, as something possessing in
infinite minuteness, solidity, palpability, weight.  Destroy the idea
of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard
the ether as an entity, or at least as matter.  For want of a better word
we might term it spirit.  Take, now, a step beyond the luminiferous
ether—conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether, as this
ether is more rare than the metal, and we arrive at once (in spite of all
the school dogmas) at a unique mass—an unparticled matter.  For
although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves,
the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an
absurdity.  There will be a point—there will be a degree of rarity,
at which, if the atoms are sufficiently numerous, the interspaces must
vanish, and the mass absolutely coalesce.  But the consideration of
the atomic constitution being now taken away, the nature of the
mass inevitably glides into what we conceive
<pb id="poe52" n="52"/>
spirit.  It is clear, however, that it is as fully matter as before.
The truth is, it is impossible to conceive spirit, since it is impossible
to imagine what is not.  When we flatter ourselves that we have
formed its conception, we have merely deceived our understanding
by the consideration of infinitely ratified matter.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> There seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of
absolute coalescence;—and that is the very slight resistance
experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through
space—a resistance now ascertained, it is true, to exist in <hi rend="italics">some</hi>
degree, but which is, nevertheless, so slight as to have been quite
overlooked by the sagacity even of Newton.  We know that the
resistance of bodies is, chiefly, in proportion to their density.
Absolute coalescence is absolute density.  Where there are no
interspaces, there can be no yielding.  An ether, absolutely dense,
would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a star
than would an ether of adamant or of iron.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in
the ratio of its apparent unanswerability.—As regards the progress
of the star, it can make no difference whether the star passes
through the ether <hi rend="italics">or the ether through it.</hi>  There is no astronomical
error more unaccountable than that which reconciles the known
retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an
ether: for, however rare this ether be supposed, it would put a stop
to all sidereal revolution in a very far briefer period than has been
admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a
point which they found it impossible to comprehend.  The
retardation actually experienced is, on the other hand, about that
which might be expected from the <hi rend="italics">friction</hi> of the ether in the
instantaneous passage through the orb.  In the one case, the retarding
force is momentary and complete within itself—in  the other it is
endlessly accumulative.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> But in all this—in this identification of mere matter with
God—is there nothing of irreverence?  [<hi rend="italics">I was forced to repeat this
question before the sleep-waker fully comprehended my meaning.</hi>]</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Can you say <hi rend="italics">why</hi> matter should be less reverenced than mind?
But you forget that the matter of which I speak is, in all
respects, the very “mind” or “spirit” of the schools, so far as
<pb id="poe53" n="53"/>
regards its high capacities, and is, moreover, the “matter” of these
schools at the same time.  God, with all the powers attributed to
spirit, is but the perfection of matter.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You assert, then, that the unparticled matter, in motion, is
thought?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> In general, this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind.
This thought creates.  All created things are but the thoughts of God.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You say, “in general.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes.  The universal mind is God.  For new individualities, 
<hi rend="italics">matter</hi> is necessary.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> But you now speak of “mind” and “matter” as do the metaphysicians.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes—to avoid confusion.  When I say “mind,” I mean the
unparticled or ultimate matter; by “matter,” I intend all else.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You were saying that “for new individualities matter is necessary.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> Yes; for mind, existing unincorporate, is merely God.  To create
individual, thinking beings, it was necessary to incarnate portions
of the divine mind.  Thus man is individualized.  Divested of corporate
investiture, he were God.  Now, the particular motion of the incarnated
portions of the unparticled matter is the thought of man; as the motion
of the whole is that of God.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You say that divested of the body man will be God?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">After much hesitation.</hi>]  I could not have said this; it is an
absurdity.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> [<hi rend="italics">Referring to my notes.</hi>]  You <hi rend="italics">did</hi> say that “divested of corporate
investiture man were God.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> And this is true.  Man thus divested <hi rend="italics">would be</hi> God—would be
unindividualized.  But he can never be thus divested—at least never
<hi rend="italics">will be</hi>—else we must imagine an action of God returning upon
itself—a purposeless and futile action.  Man is a creature.  Creatures
are thought of God.  It is the nature of thought to be irrevocable.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> I do not comprehend.  You say that man will never put off the body?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> I say that he will never be bodiless.</p>
          <pb id="poe54" n="54"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Explain.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> There are two bodies—the rudimental and the complete;
corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly.
What we call “death,” is but the painful metamorphosis.  Our
present incarnation is progressive, preparatory, temporary.  Our
future is perfected, ultimate, immortal.  The ultimate life is the full
design.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> But of the worm's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> <hi rend="italics">We</hi>, certainly—but not the worm.  The matter of which our
rudimental body is composed, is within the ken of the organs of that
body; or, more distinctly, our rudimental organs are adapted to the
matter of which is formed the rudimental body; but not to that of
which the ultimate is composed.  The ultimate body thus escapes our
rudimental senses, and we perceive only the shell which falls, in
decaying, from the inner form; not that inner form itself; but this
inner form, as well as the shell, is appreciable by those who have
already acquired the ultimate life.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles
death.  How is this?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> When I say that it resembles death, I mean that it resembles
the ultimate life; for when I am entranced the senses of my
rudimental life are in abeyance, and I perceive external things
directly, without organs, through a medium which I shall employ in
the ultimate, unorganized life.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Unorganized?</p>
          <p>V. Yes; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought
into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter, to
the exclusion of other classes and forms.  The organs of man are
adapted to his rudimental condition, and to that only; his ultimate
condition, being unorganized, is of unlimited comprehension in all
points but one—the nature of the volition of God—that is to say,
the motion of the unparticled matter.  You will have a distinct idea of
the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire brain.  This it is <hi rend="italics">not</hi>;
but a conception of this nature will bring you near a comprehension
of what it <hi rend="italics">is</hi>.  A luminous body imparts vibration to the luminiferous
ether.  The vibrations generate similar ones within the retina;
these again communicate
<pb id="poe55" n="55"/>
similar ones to the optic nerve.  The nerve conveys similar ones to
the brain; the brain, also, similar ones to the unparticled matter
which permeates it.  The motion of this latter is thought, of which
perception is the first undulation.  This is the mode by which the
mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world;
and this external world is, to the rudimental life, limited, through
the idiosyncrasy of its organs.  But in the ultimate, unorganized life,
the external world reaches the whole body, (which is of a substance
having affinity to brain, as I have said,) with no other intervention
than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the luminiferous; and
to this ether—in unison with it—the whole body vibrates, setting
in motion the unparticled matter which permeates it.  It is to the
absence of idiosyncratic organs, therefore, that we must attribute
the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life.  To rudimental
beings, organs are the cages necessary to confine them until fledged.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You speak of rudimental “beings.”  Are there other rudimental
thinking beings than man?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> The multitudinous conglomeration of rare matter into nebulae,
planets, suns, and other bodies which are neither nebulae, suns, nor
planets, is for the sole purpose of supplying <hi rend="italics">pabulum</hi> for the
idiosyncrasy of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings.  But
for the necessity of the rudimental, prior to the ultimate life, there
would have been no bodies such as these.  Each of these is tenanted
by a distinct variety of organic, rudimental, thinking creatures.  In
all, the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted.  At
death, or metamorphosis, these creatures, enjoying the ultimate
life—immortality—and cognizant of all secrets but <hi rend="italics">the one</hi>, act all
things and pass everywhere by mere volition:—indwelling, not the
stars, which to us seem the sole palpabilities, and for the
accommodation of which we blindly deem space created—but that
SPACE itself—that infinity of which the truly substantive neatness
swallows up the star-shadows—blotting them out as non-entities
from the perception of the angels.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> You say that “but for the <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> of the rudimental life”
there would have been no stars.  But why this necessity?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> In the inorganic life, as well as in the inorganic matter
generally, there is nothing to impede the action of one simple
<pb id="poe56" n="56"/>
<hi rend="italics">unique</hi> law—the Divine Volition.  With the view of producing
impediment, the organic life and matter, (complex, substantial, and
law-encumbered,) were contrived.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> But again—why need this impediment have been produced?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> The result of law inviolate is perfection—right—negative
happiness.  The result of law inviolate is imperfection, wrong, positive
pain.  Through the impediments afforded by the number, complexity,
and substantiality of the laws of organic life and matter, the violation
of law is rendered, to a certain extent, practicable.  Thus pain, which
in the inorganic life is impossible, is possible in the organic.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> But to what good end is pain thus rendered possible?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> All things are either good or bad by comparison.  A sufficient
analysis will show that pleasure, in all cases, is but the contrast of
pain.  <hi rend="italics">Positive</hi> pleasure is a mere idea.  To be happy at any one point we
must have suffered at the same.  Never to suffer would have been never
to have been blessed.  But it has been shown that, in the inorganic life,
pain cannot be; thus the necessity for the organic. The pain of the
primitive life of Earth, is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate
life in Heaven.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">P.</hi> Still, there is one of your expressions which I find it impossible
to comprehend—“the truly <hi rend="italics">substantive</hi> vastness of infinity.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">V.</hi> This, probably, is because you have no sufficiently generic
conception of the term “<hi rend="italics">substance</hi>” itself.  We must not regard it
as a quality, but as a sentiment:—it is the perception, in thinking
beings, of the adaptation of matter to their organization. There are
many things on the Earth, which would be nihility to the inhabitants
of Venus—many things visible and tangible in Venus, which we could
not be brought to appreciate as existing at all.  But to the inorganic
beings—to the angels—the whole of the unparticled matter is
substance; that is to say, the whole of what we term “space” is to
them the truest substantiality;— the stars, meantime, through what we
consider their materiality, escaping the angelic sense, just in
proportion as the unparticled matter, through what we consider
its immateriality, eludes the organic.</p>
          <p>As the sleepwalker pronounced these latter words, in a feeble
<pb id="poe57" n="57"/>
tone, I observed on his countenance a singular expression, which
somewhat alarmed me, and induced me to awake him at once.  No sooner
had I done this, than, with a bright smile irradiating all his features,
he fell back upon his pillow and expired.  I noticed that in less
than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone.
His brow was of the coldness of ice.  Thus, ordinarily, should it have
appeared, only after long pressure from Azrael's hand.  Had the
sleep-waker, indeed, during the latter portion of his discourse, been

          <p>I AM—that is to say I <hi rend="italics">was</hi>—a great man; but I am neither the
author of Junius nor the man in the mask; for my name, I believe,
is Robert Jones, and I was born somewhere in the city of Fum-Fudge.</p>
          <p>The first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with
both hands.  My mother saw this and called me a genius: my
father wept for joy and presented me with a treatise on Nosology.
This I mastered before I was breeched.</p>
          <p>I now began to feel my way in the science, and soon came to
understand that, provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous
he might, by merely following it, arrive at a Lionship.  But my
attention was not confined to theories alone.  Every morning I gave
my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of
drams.</p>
          <p>When I came of age my father asked me, one day, If I would step
with him into his study.</p>
          <p>“My son,” said he, when we were seated, “what is the chief end of
your existence?”</p>
          <p>“My father,” I answered, “it is the study of Nosology.”</p>
          <p>“And what, Robert,” he inquired, “is Nosology?”</p>
          <p>“Sir,” I said, “it is the Science of Noses.”</p>
          <p>“And can you tell me,” he demanded, “what is the meaning of a
nose?”</p>
          <p>“A nose, my father;” I replied, greatly softened, “has been
variously defined by about a thousand different authors.” [Here
<pb id="poe59" n="59"/>
I pulled out my watch.]  “It is now noon or thereabouts—we shall
have time enough to get through with them all before midnight.  To
commence then:—The nose, according to Bartholinus, is that
protuberance—that bump—that excrescence—that—”</p>
          <p>“Will do, Robert,” interrupted the good old gentleman.  “I am
thunderstruck at the extent of your information—I am positively
—upon my soul.” [Here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon
his heart.]  “Come here!” [Here he took me by the arm.]  “Your
education may now be considered as finished —it is high time you
should scuffle for yourself—and you cannot do a better thing than
merely follow your nose—so—so—so—” [Here he kicked me
down stairs and out of the door]—“so get out of my house, and God
bless you!”</p>
          <p>As I felt within me the divine <hi rend="italics">afflatus</hi>, I considered this accident
rather fortunate than otherwise.  I resolved to be guided by the
paternal advice.  I determined to follow my nose.  I gave it a pull or
two upon the spot, and wrote a pamphlet on Nosology forthwith.</p>
          <p>All Fum-Fudge was in an uproar.</p>
          <p>“Wonderful genius!” said the Quarterly.</p>
          <p>“Superb physiologist!” said the Westminster.</p>
          <p>“Clever fellow!” said the Foreign.</p>
          <p>“Fine writer!” said the Edinburgh.</p>
          <p>“Profound thinker!” said the Dublin.</p>
          <p>“Great man!” said Bentley.</p>
          <p>“Divine soul!” said Fraser.</p>
          <p>“One of us!” said Blackwood.</p>
          <p>“Who can he be?” said Mrs. Bas-Bleu.</p>
          <p>“What can he be?” said big Miss Bas-Bleu.</p>
          <p>“Where can he be?” said little Miss Bas-Bleu.—But I paid
these people no attention whatever—I just stepped into the shop
of an artist.</p>
          <p>The Duchess of Bless-my-Soul was sitting for her portrait; the
Marquis of So-and-So was holding the Duchess' poodle; the Earl of
This-and-That was flirting with her salts; and his Royal Highness of
Touch-me-Not was leaning upon the back of her chair.</p>
          <pb id="poe60" n="60"/>
          <p>I approached the artist and turned up my nose.</p>
          <p>“Oh, beautiful!” sighed her Grace.</p>
          <p>“Oh my!” lisped the Marquis.</p>
          <p>“Oh, shocking!” groaned the Earl.</p>
          <p>“Oh, abominable!” growled his Royal Highness.</p>
          <p>“What will you take for it?” asked the artist.</p>
          <p>“For his<hi rend="italics"> nose</hi>!” shouted her Grace.</p>
          <p>“A thousand pounds,” said I, sitting down.</p>
          <p>“A thousand pounds?” inquired the artist, musingly.</p>
          <p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
          <p>“Beautiful!” said he, entranced.</p>
          <p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
          <p>“Do you warrant it?” he asked, turning the nose to the light.</p>
          <p>“I do,” said I, blowing it well.</p>
          <p>“Is it <hi rend="italics">quite</hi> original?” he inquired; touching it with
reverence. </p>
          <p>“Humph!” said I, twisting it to one side.</p>
          <p>“Has <hi rend="italics">no</hi> copy been taken?” he demanded, surveying it
through a microscope.</p>
          <p>“None,” said I, turning it up.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Admirable</hi>!” he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by
the beauty of the manoeuvre.</p>
          <p>“A thousand pounds,” said I.</p>
          <p>“A <hi rend="italics">thousand</hi> pounds?” said he.</p>
          <p>“Precisely,” said I.</p>
          <p>“A thousand <hi rend="italics">pounds</hi>?” said he.</p>
          <p>“Just so,” said I.</p>
          <p>“You shall have them,” said he.  “What a piece of <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">virtu</hi></foreign>!”  So he
drew me a check upon the spot, and took a sketch of my nose.  I
engaged rooms in Jermyn street, and sent her Majesty the ninety-
ninth edition of the “Nosology,” with a portrait of the proboscis.
—That sad little rake, the Prince of Wales, invited me to dinner.</p>
          <p>We were all lions and <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics">recherchés</foreign>.</p>
          <p>There was a modern Platonist.  He quoted Porphyry, Iamblicus,
Plotinus, Proclus, Hierocles, Maximus Tyrius, and Syrianus.</p>
          <p>There was a human-perfectibility man.  He quoted Turgot,
<pb id="poe61" n="61"/>
Price, Priestly, Condorcet, De Stael, and the “Ambitious Student
in Ill Health.”</p>
          <p>There was Sir Positive Paradox.  He observed that all fools were
philosophers, and that all philosophers were fools.</p>
          <p>There was Æstheticus Ethix.  He spoke of fire, unity, and atoms;
bi-part and pre-existent soul; affinity and discord; primitive
intelligence and homöomeria.</p>
          <p>There was Theologos Theology.  He talked of Eusebius and
Arianus; heresy and the Council of Nice; Puseyism and
consubstantialism; Homousios and Homouioisios.</p>
          <p>There was Fricassée from the Rocher de Cancale.  He mentioned
Muriton of red tongue; cauliflowers with <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">velouté</hi></foreign> sauce; veal <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">à la</hi></foreign>
St. Menehoult; marinade <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">à la</hi></foreign> St. Florentin; and orange jellies <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">en
mosäiques.</hi></foreign></p>
          <p>There was Bibulus O'Bumper.  He touched upon Latour and
Markbrünnen; upon Mousseux and Chambertin; upon Richbourg
and St. George; upon Haubrion, Leonville, and Medoc; upon Barac
and Preignac; upon Grâve, upon Sauterne, upon Lafitte, and upon
St. Peray.  He shook his head at Clos de Vougeot, and told, with his
eyes shut, the difference between Sherry and Amontillado.</p>
          <p>There was Signor Tintontintino from Florence.  He discoursed of
Cimabué, Arpino, Carpaccio, and Argostino—of the gloom of
Caravaggio, of the amenity of Albano, of the colors of Titian, of the
frows of Rubens, and of the waggeries of Jan Steen.</p>
          <p>There was the President of the Fum-Fudge University.  He was
of opinion that the moon was called Bendis in Thrace, Bubastis in
Egypt, Dian in Rome, and Artemis in Greece.</p>
          <p>There was a Grand Turk from Stamboul.  He could not help thinking
that the angels were horses, cocks, and bulls; that somebody
in the sixth heaven had seventy thousand heads; and that the
earth was supported by a sky-blue cow with an incalculable
number of green horns.</p>
          <p>There was Delphinus Polyglott.  He told us what had become of
the eighty-three lost tragedies of Æschylus; of the fifty-four
orations of Isæus; of the three hundred and ninety-one speeches of
Lysias; of the hundred and eighty treatises of Theophrastus; of the
eighth book of the conic sections of Apollonius; of Pindar's
<pb id="poe62" n="62"/>
hymns and dithyrambics; and of the five and forty tragedies of
Homer Junior.</p>
          <p>There was Ferdinand Fitz-Fossillus Feltspar.  He informed us all
about internal fires and tertiary formations; about äeriforms,
fluidiforms, and solidiforms; about quartz and marl; about schist and
schorl; about gypsum and trap; about talc and calc; about blende and
horn-blende; about mica-slate and pudding-stone; about cyanite and
lepidolite; about hematite and tremolite; about antimony and
calcedony; about manganese and whatever you please.</p>
          <p>There was myself.  I spoke of myself;—of myself, of myself, of
myself;—of Nosology, of my pamphlet, and of myself.  I turned up
my nose, and I spoke of myself.</p>
          <p>“Marvellous clever man!” said the Prince.</p>
          <p>“Superb!” said his guests:—and next morning her Grace of
Bless-my-Soul paid me a visit.</p>
          <p>“Will you go to Almack's, pretty creature?” she said, tapping me
under the chin.</p>
          <p>“Upon honor,” said I.</p>
          <p>“Nose and all?” she asked.</p>
          <p>“As I live,” I replied.</p>
          <p>“Here then is a card, my life.  Shall I say you <hi rend="italics">will</hi> be there?”</p>
          <p>“Dear Duchess, with all my heart.”</p>
          <p>“Pshaw, no!—but with all your nose?”</p>
          <p>“Every bit of it, my love,” said I: so I gave it a twist or two,
and found myself at Almack's.</p>
          <p>The rooms were crowded to suffocation.</p>
          <p>“He is coming!” said somebody on the staircase.</p>
          <p>“He is coming!” said somebody farther up.</p>
          <p>“He is coming!” said somebody farther still.</p>
          <p>“He is come!” exclaimed the Duchess.  “He is come, the little
love!”—and, seizing me firmly by both hands, she kissed me
thrice upon the nose.</p>
          <p>A marked sensation immediately ensued.</p>
          <p>“<foreign lang="ita" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Diavolo</hi></foreign>!” cried Count Capricornutti.</p>
          <p>“<foreign lang="spa" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Dios guarda</hi></foreign>!” muttered Don Stiletto.</p>
          <p>“<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Mille tonnerres</hi></foreign>!” ejaculated the Prince de Grenouille.</p>
          <pb id="poe63" n="63"/>
          <p>“<foreign lang="ger" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Tousand teufel!</hi></foreign>” growled the Elector of Bluddennuff.</p>
          <p>It was not to be borne.  I grew angry.  I turned short upon
Bluddennuff.</p>
          <p>“Sir!” said I to him, “you are a baboon.”</p>
          <p>“Sir,” he replied, after a pause, “<foreign lang="ger" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Donner und Blitzen!</hi></foreign>”</p>
          <p>This was all that could be desired.  We exchanged cards.  At
Chalk-Farm, the next morning, I shot off his nose—and then called
upon my friends.</p>
          <p>“<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Bête!</hi></foreign>” said the first.</p>
          <p>“Fool!” said the second.</p>
          <p>“Dolt!” said the third.</p>
          <p>“Ass!” said the fourth.</p>
          <p>“Ninny!” said the fifth.</p>
          <p>“Noodle!” said the sixth.</p>
          <p>“Be off!” said the seventh.</p>
          <p>At all this I felt mortified, and so called upon my father.</p>
          <p>“Father,” I asked, “what is the chief end of my existence?”</p>
          <p>“My son,” he replied, “it is still the study of Nosology; but in
hitting the Elector upon the nose you have overshot your mark.  You
have a fine nose, it is true; but then Bluddennuff has none.  You are
damned, and he has become the hero of the day.  I grant you that
in Fum-Fudge the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of
his proboscis—but, good heavens! there is no competing with a
lion who has no proboscis at all.”</p>

          <p>DURING the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the
autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the
heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a
singularly dreary tract of country; and at length found myself, as the
shades of the evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House
of Usher.  I know not how it was—but, with the first glimpse of the
building, a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit.  I say
insufferable; for the feeling was unrelieved by any of that half-pleasurable,
because poetic, sentiment, with which the mind usually
receives even the sternest natural images of the desolate or terrible.
I looked upon the scene before me—upon the mere house, and the
simple landscape features of the domain—upon the bleak
walls—upon the vacant eye-like windows—upon a few rank
sedges—and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees—with an
utter depression of soul which I can compare to no earthly sensation
more properly than to the after-dream of the reveller upon
opium—the bitter lapse into everyday life—the hideous dropping
off of the veil.  There was an iciness, a sinking, a sickening of the
heart—an unredeemed dreariness of thought which no goading of the
imagination could torture into aught of the sublime.  What was it—
I paused to think—what was it that so unnerved me in the
contemplation of the House of Usher?  It was a mystery all
insoluble; nor could I grapple with the shadowy fancies that
crowded upon me as I
<pb id="poe65" n="65"/>
pondered.  I was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory
conclusion, that while, beyond doubt, there are combinations of very
simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us,
still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond
our depth.  It was possible, I reflected, that a mere different
arrangement of the particulars of the scene, of the details of the
picture, would be sufficient to modify, or perhaps to annihilate its
capacity for sorrowful impression; and, acting upon this idea, I
reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn
that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling, and gazed down—but
with a shudder even more thrilling than before—upon the remodelled
and inverted images of the gray sedge, and the ghastly tree-stems,
and the vacant and eye-like windows.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, in this mansion of gloom I now proposed to myself a
sojourn of some weeks.  Its proprietor, Roderick Usher, had been
one of my boon companions in boyhood; but many years had elapsed
since our last meeting.  A letter, however, had lately reached me
in a distant part of the country—a letter from him—which, in
its wildly importunate nature, had admitted of no other than a
personal reply.  The MS. gave evidence of nervous agitation.  The
writer spoke of acute bodily illness—of a mental disorder which
oppressed him—and of an earnest desire to see me, as his best,
and indeed his only personal friend, with a view of attempting, by
the cheerfulness of my society, some alleviation of his malady.  It
was the manner in which all this, and much more, was said—it was
the apparent <hi rend="italics">heart</hi> that went with his request—which allowed me no
room for hesitation; and I accordingly obeyed forthwith what I still
considered a very singular summons.</p>
          <p>Although, as boys, we had been even intimate associates, yet I
really knew little of my friend.  His reserve had been always
excessive and habitual.  I was aware, however, that his very ancient
family had been noted, time out of mind, for a peculiar sensibility
of temperament, displaying itself, through long ages, in many
works of exalted art, and manifested, of late, in repeated deeds of
munificent yet unobtrusive charity, as well as in a passionate
devotion to the intricacies, perhaps even more than to the
orthodox and easily recognisable beauties, of musical
<pb id="poe66" n="66"/>
science.  I had learned, too, the remarkable fact, that the stem of the
Usher race, all time-honored as it was, had put forth, at no period,
any enduring branch; in other words, that the entire family lay in the
direct line of descent, and had always, with very trifling and very
temporary variation, so lain.  It was this deficiency, I considered,
while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of
the premises with the accredited character of the people, and while
speculating upon the possible influence which the one, in the long
lapse of centuries, might have exercised upon the other—it was this
deficiency, perhaps, of collateral issue, and the consequent
undeviating transmission, from sire to son, of the patrimony with
the name, which had, at length, so identified the two as to merge the
original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of
the “House of Usher”—an appellation which seemed to include, in
the minds of the peasantry who used it, both the family and the
family mansion.</p>
          <p>I have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment
—that of looking down within the tarn—had been to deepen the
first singular impression.  There can be no doubt that the
consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition—for why
should I not so term it?—served mainly to accelerate the increase
itself.  Such, I have long known, is the paradoxical law of all
sentiments having terror as a basis.  And it might have been for this
reason only, that, when I again uplifted my eyes to the house itself,
from its image in the pool, there grew in my mind a strange fancy—a
fancy so ridiculous, indeed, that I but mention it to show the vivid
force of the sensations which oppressed me.  I had so worked upon
my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion
and domain there hung an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and
their immediate vicinity—an atmosphere which had no affinity
with the air of heaven, but which had reeked up from the decayed
trees, and the gray wall, and the silent tarn—a pestilent and mystic
vapor, dull, sluggish, faintly discernible, and leaden-hued.</p>
          <p>Shaking off from my spirit what <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have been a dream, I
scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building.  Its
principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity.
<pb id="poe67" n="67"/>
The discoloration of ages had been great.  Minute fungi overspread
the whole exterior, hanging in a fine tangled web-work from the
eaves.  Yet all this was apart from any extraordinary dilapidation.
No portion of the masonry had fallen; and there appeared to be a
wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts, and
the crumbling condition of the individual stones.  In this there was
much that reminded me of the specious totality of old woodwork
which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault, with no
disturbance from the breath of the external air.  Beyond this
indication of extensive decay, however, the fabric gave little token of
instability.  Perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have
discovered a barely perceptible fissure, which, extending from the
roof of the building in front made its way down the wall in a zigzag
direction, until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn.</p>
          <p>Noticing these things, I rode over a short causeway to the house.
A servant in waiting took my horse, and I entered the Gothic
archway of the hall.  A valet, of stealthy step, thence conducted me,
in silence, through many dark and intricate passages in my progress
to the <hi rend="italics">studio</hi> of his master.  Much that I encountered on the way
contributed, I know not how, to heighten the vague sentiments of
which I have already spoken.  While the objects around me—while
the carvings of the ceilings, the sombre tapestries of the walls,
the ebony blackness of the floors and the phantasmagoric armorial
trophies which rattled as I strode, were but matters to which, or to
such as which, I had been accustomed from my infancy—while I
hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this—I still
wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary
images were stirring up.  On one of the staircases, I met the
physician of the family.  His countenance, I thought, wore a mingled
expression of low cunning and perplexity.  He accosted me with
trepidation and passed on.  The valet now threw open a door and
ushered me into the presence of his master.</p>
          <p>The room in which I found myself was very large and lofty.
The windows were long, narrow, and pointed, and at so vast a
distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible
from within.  Feeble gleams of encrimsoned light made their
<pb id="poe68" n="68"/>
way through trellissed panes, and served to render sufficiently
distinct the more prominent objects around; the eye, however,
struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber, or the
recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling.  Dark draperies hung
upon the walls.  The general furniture was profuse, comfortless,
antique, and tattered.  Many books and musical instruments lay
scattered about, but failed to give any vitality to the scene.  I felt
that I breathed an atmosphere of sorrow.  An air of stern, deep, and
irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all.</p>
          <p>Upon my entrance, Usher arose from a sofa on which he had
been lying at full length, and greeted me with a vivacious warmth
which had much in it, I at first thought, of an overdone cordiality—of the constrained effort of the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">ennuyé</hi></foreign> man of the world.  A
glance, however, at his countenance, convinced me of his perfect
sincerity.  We sat down; and for some moments, while he spoke not,
I gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity, half of awe.  Surely,
man had never before so terribly altered, in so brief a period, as had
Roderick Usher!  It was with difficulty that I could bring myself to
admit the identity of the wan being before me with the companion
of my early boyhood.  Yet the character of his face had been at all
times remarkable.  A cadaverousness of complexion; an eye large,
liquid, and luminous beyond comparison; lips somewhat thin and
very pallid, but of a surpassingly beautiful curve; a nose of a delicate
Hebrew model, but with a breadth of nostril unusual in similar
formations; a finely moulded chin, speaking, in its want of
prominence, of a want of moral energy; hair of a more than web-like
softness and tenuity; these features, with an inordinate expansion
above the regions of the temple, made up altogether a countenance
not easily to be forgotten.  And now in the mere exaggeration of the
prevailing character of these features, and of the expression they
were wont to convey, lay so much of change that I doubted to
whom I spoke.  The now ghastly pallor of the skin, and the now
miraculous lustre of the eye, above all things startled and even
awed me.  The silken hair, too, had been suffered to grow all
unheeded, and as, in its wild gossamer texture, it floated rather
than fell about the
<pb id="poe69" n="69"/>
face, I could not, even with effort, connect its Arabesque expression
with any idea of simple humanity.</p>
          <p>In the manner of my friend I was at once struck with an incoherence
—an inconsistency; and I soon found this to arise from a
series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual
trepidancy an excessive nervous agitation. For something of this
nature I had indeed been prepared, no less by his letter, than by
reminiscences of certain boyish traits, and by conclusions deduced
from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament. His
action was alternately vivacious and sullen. His voice varied rapidly
from a tremulous indecision (when the animal spirits seemed utterly
in abeyance) to that species of energetic concision—that abrupt,
weighty, unhurried, and hollow-sounding enunciation—that leaden,
self-balanced and perfectly modulated guttural utterance, which
may be observed in the lost drunkard, or the irreclaimable eater of
opium, during the periods of his most intense excitement.</p>
          <p>It was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit, of his earnest
desire to see me, and of the solace he expected me to afford him.  He
entered, at some length, into what he conceived to be the nature of
his malady.  It was, he said, a constitutional and a family evil, and
one for which he despaired to find a remedy—a mere nervous
affection, he immediately added, which would undoubtedly soon
pass off.  It displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations.
Some of these, as he detailed them, interested and bewildered me;
although, perhaps, the terms, and the general manner of the
narration had their weight.  He suffered much from a morbid
acuteness of the senses; the most insipid food was alone endurable;
he could wear only garments of certain texture; the odors of all
flowers were oppressive; his eyes were tortured by even a faint
light; and there were but peculiar sounds, and these from stringed
instruments, which did not inspire him with horror.</p>
          <p>To an anomalous species of terror I found him a bounden slave.  “I
shall perish,” said he, “I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> perish in this deplorable folly.
Thus, thus, and not otherwise, shall I be lost.  I dread the events of
the future, not in themselves, but in their results.  I shudder at the
thought of any, even the most trivial,
<pb id="poe70" n="70"/>
incident, which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul.  I
have, indeed, no abhorrence of danger, except in its absolute effect
—in terror.  In this unnerved—in this pitiable condition—I feel
that the period will sooner or later arrive when I must abandon life
and reason together, in some struggle with the grim phantasm, FEAR.”</p>
          <p>I learned, moreover, at intervals, and through broken and equivocal
hints, another singular feature of his mental condition.  He
was enchained by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the
dwelling which he tenanted, and whence, for many years, he had
never ventured forth—in regard to an influence whose
supposititious force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be
re-stated—an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form
and substance of his family mansion, had, by dint of long
sufferance, he said, obtained over his spirit—an effect which the
<hi rend="italics">physique</hi> of the gray walls and turrets, and of the dim tarn into
which they all looked down, had, at length, brought about upon the
<hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of his existence.</p>
          <p>He admitted, however, although with hesitation, that much of the
peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more
natural and far more palpable origin—to the severe and long-
continued illness—indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution
—of a tenderly beloved sister—his sole companion for long
years—his last and only relative on earth.  “Her decease,” he said,
with a bitterness which I can never forget, “would leave him (him
the hopeless and the frail) the last of the ancient race of the
Ushers.”  While he spoke, the lady Madeline (for so was she called)
passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment, and,
without having noticed my presence, disappeared.  I regarded her
with an utter astonishment not unmingled with dread—and yet I
found it impossible to account for such feelings.  A sensation of
stupor oppressed me, as my eyes followed her retreating steps.
When a door, at length, closed upon her, my glance sought
instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother—but he
had buried his face in his hands, and I could only perceive that a far
more than ordinary wariness had overspread the emaciated fingers
through which trickled many passionate tears.</p>
          <pb id="poe71" n="71"/>
          <p>The disease of the lady Madeline had long baffled the skill of her
physicians.  A settled apathy, a gradual wasting away of the
person, and frequent although transient affections of a partially
cataleptical character, were the unusual diagnosis.  Hitherto she had
steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady and had not
betaken herself finally to bed; but, on the closing of the evening
of my arrival at the house, she succumbed (as her brother told me at
night with inexpressible agitation) to the prostrating power of the
destroyer; and I learned that the glimpse I had obtained of her
person would thus probably be the last I should obtain—that the
lady, at least while living, would be seen by me no more.</p>
          <p>For several days ensuing, her name was unmentioned by either
Usher or myself: and during this period I was busied in earnest
endeavors to alleviate the melancholy of my friend.  We painted and
read together; or I listened, as if in a dream, to the wild
improvisations of his speaking guitar.  And thus, as a close and still
closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly in the recesses of
his spirit, the more bitterly did I perceive the futility of all attempt
at cheering a mind from which darkness, as if an inherent positive
quality, poured forth upon all object of the moral and physical
universe, in one unceasing radiation of gloom.</p>
          <p>I shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours I
thus spent alone with the master of the House of Usher.  Yet I
should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character
of the studies, or of the occupations, in which he involved me, or
led me the way.  An excited and highly distempered ideality threw
a sulphureous lustre over all.  His long improvised dirges will ring
forever in my ears.  Among other things, I hold painfully in mind a
certain singular perversion an amplification of the wild air of the
last waltz of Von Weber.  From the paintings over which his
elaborate fancy brooded, and which grew, touch by touch, into
vaguenesses at which I shuddered the more thrillingly, because I
shuddered knowing not why;—from these paintings (vivid as their
images now are before me) I would in vain endeavor to educe more
than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely
written
<pb id="poe72" n="72"/>
words.  By the utter simplicity, by the nakedness of his designs, he
arrested and overawed attention.  If ever mortal painted an idea, that
mortal was Roderick Usher.  For me at least—in the circumstances
then surrounding me—there arose out of the pure abstractions
which the hypochondriac contrived to throw upon his canvass, an
intensity of intolerable awe, no shadow of which felt I ever yet in
the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries
of Fusilli.</p>
          <p>One of the phantasmagoric conceptions of my friend, partaking
not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction, may be shadowed forth,
although feebly, in words.  A small picture presented the interior of
an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel, with low walls
smooth, white, and without interruption or device.  Certain
accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that
this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the
earth.  No outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent, and
no torch, or other artificial source of light was discernible; yet a
flood of intense rays rolled throughout, and bathed the whole in a
ghastly and inappropriate splendor.</p>
          <p>I have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve
which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer, with the
exception of certain effects of stringed instruments.  It was, perhaps,
the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar,
which gave birth, in great measure, to the fantastic character of his
performances.  But the fervid <hi rend="italics">facility</hi> of his <hi rend="italics">impromptus</hi> could not
be so accounted for.  They must have been, and were, in the notes,
as well as in the words of his wild fantasias (for he not unfrequently
accompanied himself with rhymed verbal improvisations), the result of
that intense mental collectedness and concentration to which I have
previously alluded as observable only in particular mounts of the highest
artificial excitement.  The words of one of these rhapsodies I have
easily remembered.  I was, perhaps, the more forcibly impressed with it,
as be gave it, because, in the under or mystic current of in its meaning,
I fancied that I perceived, and for the first time, a full consciousness
on the part of Usher, of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne.
The verses, which were entitled “The Haunted Palace,” ran very nearly, if

          </lg>
          <p>I well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad, led
us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an
opinion of Usher's which I mention not so much on account of its
novelty, (for other men<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" target="note1">*</ref> have thought thus,) as on account of the
pertinacity with which he maintained it.  This opinion, in its
general form, was that of the sentience of all vegetable things.
But, in his disordered fancy, the idea had assumed a more daring
character, and trespassed, under certain conditions, upon the
kingdom of inorganization.  I lack words to express the full extent,
or the earnest <hi rend="italics">abandon</hi> of his persuasion.  The belief, however
was connected (as I have previously hinted) with the gray stones
of the home of his forefathers.  The conditions of the sentience
had been here, he imagined, fulfilled in the method of collocation
of these stones—in the order of their arrangement, as well as
in that of the many <hi>fungi</hi> which overspread them, and of the
decayed trees which stood around—above all, in the long
undisturbed endurance of this arrangement, and in its reduplication
in the still waters of the tarn.  Its evidence—the evidence of the
sentience—was to be seen, he said, (and I here started as he
spoke,) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere
of their own about the waters and the walls.  The result was
discoverable, he added, in that silent, yet importunate and terrible
influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his
<note id="note1" n="1" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">*Watson, Dr. Percival, Spallanzani, and especially the Bishop of
Landaff.—See “Chemical Essays,” vol v.</note>
<pb id="poe75" n="75"/>
family, and which made <hi rend="italics">him</hi> what I now saw him—what he was.
Such opinions need no comment, and I will make none.</p>
          <p>Our books—the books which, for years, had formed no small
portion of the mental existence of the invalid—were, as might be
supposed, in strict keeping with this character of phantasm.  We
pored together over such works as the Ververt et Chartreuse of
Gresset; the Belphegor of Machiavelli; the Heaven and Hell of
Swedenborg; the Subterranean Voyage of Nicholas Klimm by
Holberg; the Chiromancy of Robert Flud, of Jean D'Indaginé, and of
De la Chambre; the Journey into the Blue Distance of Tieck; and the
City of the Sun of Campanella.  One favorite volume was a small
octavo edition of the <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Directorium Inquisitorium</hi></foreign>, by the Dominican
Eymeric de Gironne; and there were passages in Pomponius Mela,
about the old African Satyrs and Œgipans, over which Usher would
sit dreaming for hours.  His chief delight, however, was found in the
perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto Gothic—
the manual of a forgotten church—the <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Vigiliae Mortuorum secundum
Chorum Ecclesiae Maguntinae</hi></foreign>.</p>
          <p>I could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work, and of its
probable influence upon the hypochondriac, when, one evening,
having informed me abruptly that the lady Madeline was no more, he
stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight,
(previously to its final interment,) in one of the numerous vaults
within the main walls of the building.  The worldly reason, however,
assigned for this singular proceeding, was one which I did not feel at
liberty to dispute.  The brother had been led to his resolution (so he
told me) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of
the deceased, of certain obtrusive and eager inquiries on the part of
her medical men, and of the remote and exposed situation of the
burial-ground of the family.  I will not deny that when I called to
mind the sinister countenance of the person whom I met upon the
staircase, on the day of my arrival at the house, I had no desire to
oppose what I regarded as at best but a harmless, and by no means
an unnatural, precaution.</p>
          <p>At the request of Usher, I personally aided him in the arrangements
for the temporary entombment. The body having been encoffined,
we two alone bore it to its rest. The vault in which
<pb id="poe76" n="76"/>
we placed it (and which had been so long unopened that our torches,
half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere, gave us little
opportunity for investigation) was small, damp, and entirely
without means of admission for light; lying, at great depth,
immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my
own sleeping apartment. It had been used, apparently, in remote
feudal times, for the worst purposes of a donjon-keep, and, in later
days, as a place of deposit for powder, or some other highly
combustible substance, as a portion of its floor, and the whole
interior of a long archway through which we reached it, were
carefully sheathed with copper.  The door, of massive iron, had been,
also, similarly protected.  Its immense weight caused an unusually
sharp grating sound, as it moved upon its hinges.</p>
          <p>Having deposited our mournful burden upon tressels within this
region of horror, we partially turned aside the yet unscrewed lid of
the coffin, and looked upon the face of the tenant.  A striking
similitude between the brother and sister now first arrested my
attention; and Usher, divining, perhaps, my thoughts, murmured out
some few words from which I learned that the deceased and himself
had been twins, and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature
had always existed between them.  Our glances, however, rested not
long upon the dead—for we could not regard her unawed.  The disease
which had thus entombed the lady in the maturity of youth, had left,
as usual in all maladies of a strictly cataleptical character, the
mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face, and that
suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in
death.  We replaced and screwed down the lid, and, having secured the
door of iron, made our way, with toil, into the scarcely less gloomy
apartments of the upper portion of the house.</p>
          <p>And now, some days of bitter grief having elapsed, an observable
change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend.
His ordinary manner had vanished.  His ordinary occupations were
neglected or forgotten.  He roamed from chamber to chamber with
hurried, unequal, and objectless step.  The pallor of his countenance
had assumed, if possible, a more ghastly hue—but the
luminousness of his eye had utterly gone out.  The once occasional
huskiness of his tone was heard no more; and a
<pb id="poe77" n="77"/>
tremulous quaver, as if of extreme terror, habitually characterized
his utterance. There were times, indeed, when I thought his
unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive
secret, to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage.  At
times, again, I was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable
vagaries of madness, for I beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long
hours, in an attitude of the profoundest attention, as if listening to
some imaginary sound.  It was no wonder that his condition
terrified—that it infected me.  I felt creeping upon me, by slow yet
certain degrees, the wild influences of his own fantastic yet
impressive superstitions.</p>
          <p>It was, especially, upon retiring to bed late in the night of the
seventh or eighth day after the placing of the lady Madeline within
the donjon, that I experienced the full power of such feelings.  Sleep
came not near my couch—while the hours waned and waned away.
I struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over
me.  I endeavored to believe that much, if not all of what I felt, was
due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the
room—of the dark and tattered draperies, which, tortured into
motion by the breath of arising tempest, swayed fitfully to and fro
upon the walls, and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the
bed.  But my efforts were fruitless.  An irrepressible tremor gradually
pervaded my frame; and, at length, there sat upon my very heart an
incubus of utterly causeless alarm.  Shaking this off with a gasp and
a struggle, I uplifted myself upon the pillows, and, peering earnestly
within the intense darkness of the chamber, harkened—I know
not why, except that an instinctive spirit prompted me—to certain
low and indefinite sounds which came, through the pauses of the
storm, at long intervals, I knew not whence.  Overpowered by an
intense sentiment of horror, unaccountable yet unendurable, I threw
on my clothes with haste (for I felt that I should sleep no more during
the night), and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable
condition into which I had fallen, by pacing rapidly to and fro
through the apartment.</p>
          <p>I had taken but few turns in this manner, when a light step on
an adjoining staircase arrested my attention.  I presently recognise
it as that of Usher.  In an instant afterward he rapped,
<pb id="poe78" n="78"/>
with a gentle touch, at my door, and entered, bearing a lamp.  His
countenance was, as usual, cadaverously wan—but, moreover,
there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes—an evidently
restrained <hi rend="italics">hysteria</hi> in his whole demeanor.  His air appalled me—but
anything was preferable to the solitude which I had so long endured
and I even welcomed his presence as a relief.</p>
          <p>“And you have not seen it?” he said abruptly, after having stared
about him for some moments in silence—“you have not then seen it?
—but, stay! you shall.” Thus speaking, and having carefully
shaded his lamp, he hurried to one of the casements. and threw it
freely open to the storm.</p>
          <p>The impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our
feet.  It was, indeed, a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night, and
one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty.  A whirlwind had
apparently collected its force in our vicinity; for there were frequent
and violent alterations in the direction of the wind; and the exceeding
density of the clouds (which hung so low as to press upon the
turrets of the house) did not prevent our perceiving the life-like
velocity with which they flew careering from all points against each
other, without passing away into the distance.  I say that even their
exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this—yet we had
no glimpse of the moon or stars—nor was there any flashing forth
of the lightning.  But the under surfaces of the huge masses of
agitated vapor, as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around
us, were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and
distinctly visible gaseous exhalation which hung about and
enshrouded the mansion.</p>
          <p>“You must not—you shall not behold this!” said I, shudderingly,
to Usher, as I led him, with a gentle violence, from the window to
a seat.  “These appearances, which bewilder you, are merely
electrical phenomena not uncommon—or it may be that they have
their ghastly origin in the rank miasma of the tarn.  Let us close this
casement;—the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame.  Here
is one of your favorite romances. I will read, and you shall listen;—
and so we will pass away this terrible night together.”</p>
          <p>The antique volume which I had taken up was the “Mad Trist” of
Sir Launcelot Canning; but I had called it a favorite
<pb id="poe79" n="79"/>
of Usher's more in sad jest than in earnest; for, in truth, there is little
in its uncouth and unimaginative prolixity which could have had
interest for the lofty and spiritual ideality of my friend.  It was,
however, the only book immediately at hand; and I indulged a
vague hope that the excitement which now agitated the
hypochondriac, might find relief (for the history of mental disorder
is full of similar anomalies) even in the extremeness of the folly
which I should read.  Could I have judged, indeed, by the wild
overstrained air of vivacity with which he harkened, or apparently
harkened, to the words of the tale, I might well have congratulated
myself upon the success of my design.</p>
          <p>I had arrived at that well known portion of the story where
Ethelred, the hero of the Trist, having sought in vain for peaceable
admission into the dwelling of the hermit, proceeds to make good an
entrance by force.  Here, it will be remembered, the words of the
narrative run thus:</p>
          <p>“And Ethelred, who was by nature of a doughty heart, and who
was now mighty withal, on account of the powerfulness of the wine
which he had drunken, waited no longer to hold parley with the
hermit, who, in sooth, was of an obstinate and maliceful turn, but,
feeling the rain upon his shoulders, and fearing the rising of the
tempest, uplifted his mace outright, and, with blows, made quickly
room in the plankings of the door for his gauntleted hand; and now
pulling therewith sturdily, he so cracked, and ripped, and tore all
asunder, that the noise of the dry and hollow-sounding wood
alarummed and reverberated throughout the forest.”</p>
          <p>At the termination of this sentence I started, and for a moment,
paused; for it appeared to me (although I at once concluded that my
excited fancy had deceived me)—it appeared to me that, from some
very remote portion of the mansion, there came, indistinctly, to
my ears, what might have been, in its exact similarity of character,
the echo (but a stifled and dull one certainly) of the very cracking
and ripping sound which Sir Launcelot had so particularly
described.  It was, beyond doubt, the coincidence alone which had
arrested my attention; for, amid the rattling of the sashes of the
casements, and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing
storm, the sound, in itself, had nothing,
<pb id="poe80" n="80"/>
surely, which should have interested or disturbed me.  I continued the
story:</p>
          <p>“But the good champion Ethelred, now entering within the door,
was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the maliceful
hermit; but, in the stead thereof, a dragon of a scaly and prodigious
demeanor, and of a fiery tongue, which sate in guard before a palace
of gold, with a floor of silver; and upon the wall there hung a shield
of shining brass with this legend enwritten—</p>
          <lg>
            <l>Who entereth herein, a conqueror hath bin;</l>
            <l>Who slayeth the dragon, the shield he shall win;</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And Ethelred uplifted his mace, and struck upon the head of the
dragon, which fell before him, and gave up his pesty breath, with a
shriek so horrid and harsh, and withal so piercing, that Ethelred
had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it,
the like whereof was never before heard.”</p>
          <p>Here again I paused abruptly, and now with a feeling of wild
amazement—for there could be no doubt whatever that, in this
instance, I did actually hear (although from what direction it
proceeded I found it impossible to say) a low and apparently distant,
but harsh, protracted, and most unusual screaming or grating
sound—the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already
conjured up for the dragon's unnatural shriek as described by the
romancer.</p>
          <p>Oppressed, as I certainly was, upon the occurrence of this
second and most extraordinary coincidence by a thousand
conflicting sensations, in which wonder and extreme terror were
predominant, I still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid
exciting, by any observation, the sensitive nervousness of my
companion.  I was by no means certain that he had noticed the
sounds in question; although, assuredly, a strange alteration had,
during the last few minutes, taken place in his demeanor.  From a
position fronting my own, he had gradually brought round his chair,
so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber; and thus I
could but partially perceive his features, although I saw that his lips
trembled as if he were murmuring inaudibly.  His head had dropped
upon his breast—yet I knew that he was not
<pb id="poe81" n="81"/>
asleep, from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as I caught a
glance of it in profile.  The motion of his body, too, was at variance
with this idea—for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet
constant and uniform sway.  Having rapidly taken notice of all this,
I resumed the narrative of Sir Launcelot which thus proceeded:</p>
          <p>“And now, the champion, having escaped from the terrible fury
of the dragon, bethinking himself of the brazen shield, and of the
breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it, removed the
carcass from out of the way before him, and approached
valorously over the silver pavement of the castle to where the
shield was upon the wall; which in sooth tarried not for his full
coming, but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor with a mighty
great and terrible ringing sound.”</p>
          <p>No sooner had these syllables passed my lips, than—as if a
shield of brass had indeed, at the moment, fallen heavily upon a
floor of silver—I became aware of a distinct, hollow, metallic and
clangorous, yet apparently muffled reverberation.  Completely
unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured rocking movement
of Usher was undisturbed.  I rushed to the chair in which he sat.  His
eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole
countenance there reigned a stony rigidity.  But, as I placed my
hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his
whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that
he spoke in a low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious
of my presence.  Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the
hideous import of his words.</p>
          <p>“Not hear it?—yes, I hear it, and <hi rend="italics">have</hi> heard it.  Long—long—
long—many minutes, many hours, many days, have I heard
it—yet I dared not—oh, pity me, miserable wretch that I am!—I
dared not—I <hi rend="italics">dared</hi> not speak!  <hi rend="italics">We have put her living in the tomb!</hi>
Said I not that my senses were acute?  I <hi rend="italics">now</hi> tell you that I heard
her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin.  I heard them—
many, many days ago—yet I dared not—<hi rend="italics">I dared not speak!</hi>
And now—to-night—Ethelred—ha! ha!—the breaking of the
hermit's door, and the death-cry of the dragon, and the clangor of
the shield!—say, rather, the rending of her coffin,
<pb id="poe82" n="82"/>
and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison, and her struggles
within the coppered archway of the vault!  Oh whither shall I fly?
Will she not be here anon?  Is she not hurrying to upbraid me for
my haste?  Have I not heard her footstep on the stair?  Do I not
distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?  Madman!”
—here he sprang furiously to his feet and shrieked out his syllables,
as if in the effort he were giving up his soul—<hi rend="italics">“Madman!  I tell you
that she now stands without the door!”</hi></p>
          <p>As if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been
found the potency of a spell—the huge antique pannels to which
the speaker pointed, threw slowly back, upon the instant, their
ponderous and ebony jaws.  It was the work of the rushing gust—
but then without those doors there <hi rend="italics">did</hi> stand the lofty and enshrouded
figure of the lady Madeline of Usher.  There was blood upon her
white robes, and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every
portion of her emaciated frame.  For a moment she remained 
trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold—then, with a
low moaning cry, fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother,
and in her violent and now final death-agonies, bore him to the floor
a corpse, and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated.</p>
          <p>From that chamber, and from that mansion, I fled aghast.  The storm
was still abroad in all its wrath as I found myself crossing the old
causeway.  Suddenly there shot along the path a wild light, and I
turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued; for the
vast house and its shadows were alone behind me.  The radiance was
that of the full, setting, and blood-red moon, which now shone vividly
through that once barely-discernible fissure rapidly widened—there
came a fierce breath of the whirlwind—the entire orb of the satellite
burst at once upon my sight—my brain reeled as I saw the mighty
walls rushing asunder—there was a long tumultuous shouting sound
like the voice of a thousand waters—and the deep and dank tarn at
my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the “<hi rend="italics">House
of Usher</hi>.”</p>

          <p>We had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag.  For some
minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak.</p>
          <p>“Not long ago,” said he at length, “and I could have guided you on
this route as well as the youngest of my sons; but about three years
past, there happened to me an event such as never happened to
mortal man—or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of—
and the six hours of deadly terror which I then endured have
broken me up body and soul.  You suppose me a <hi rend="italics">very</hi> old man—but I am not.  It took less than a single day to change these hairs
from jetty black to white, to weaken my limbs, and to unstring 
my nerves, so that I tremble at the least exertion, and am 
frightened at a shadow.  Do you know I can scarcely look over 
this little cliff without getting giddy?”</p>
          <p>The “little cliff,” upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown 
himself down to rest that the weightier portion of his body hung
over it, while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his
elbow on its extreme and slippery edge—this “little cliff” arose,
a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock, some fifteen
or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us.
Nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of
its brink.  In truth so deeply was I excited by the perilous
position of my companion, that I fell at full length upon the
ground, clung
<pb id="poe84" n="84"/>
to the shrubs around me, and dared not even glance upward at
the sky—while I struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea
that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from
the fury of the winds.  It was long before I could reason myself
into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance.</p>
          <p>“You must get over these fancies,” said the guide, “for I have
brought you here that you might have the best possible view of
the scene of that event I mentioned—and to tell you the whole
story with the spot just under your eye.”</p>
          <p>“We are now,” he continued, in that particularizing manner
which distinguished him—“we are now close upon the
Norwegian coast—in the sixty-eighth degree of latitude—in the
great province of Nordland—and in the dreary district of
Lofoden.  The mountain upon whose top we sit is Helseggen, the
Cloudy.  Now raise yourself up a little higher—hold on to the
grass if you feel giddy—so—and look out, beyond the belt of
vapor beneath us, into the sea.”</p>
          <p>I looked dizzily, and beheld a wide expanse of ocean, whose
waters wore so inky a hue as to bring at once to my mind the
Nubian geographer's account of the <hi rend="italics">Mare Tenebrarum</hi>.  A
panorama more deplorably desolate no human imagination can
conceive.  To the right and left, as far as the eye could reach,
there lay outstretched, like ramparts of the world, lines of
horridly black and beetling cliff, whose character of gloom was
but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up
against its white and ghastly crest, howling and shrieking forever.
Just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed,
and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea, there was
visible a small, bleak looking island; or, more properly, its
position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in
which it was enveloped.  About two miles nearer the land, arose
another of smaller size, hideously craggy and barren, and
encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks.</p>
          <p>The appearance of the ocean, in the space between the more
distant island and the shore, had something very unusual about it.
Although, at the time, so strong a gale was blowing landward that
a brig in the remote offing lay to under a double-reefed trysail,
and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight, still there was
<pb id="poe85" n="85"/>
here nothing like a regular swell, but only a short, quick, angry
cross dashing of water in every direction—as well in the teeth
of the wind as otherwise.  Of foam there was little except in the
immediate vicinity of the rocks.</p>
          <p>“The island in the distance,” resumed the old man, “is called by
the Norwegians Vurrgh.  The one midway is Moskoe.  That a
mile to the northward is Ambaaren.  Yonder are Islesen, Hotholm,
Keildhelm, Suarven, and Buckholm.  Farther off—between
Moskoe and Vurrgh—are Otterholm, Flimen, Sandflesen, and
Stockholm.  These are the true names of the places—but why
it has been thought necessary to name them at all, is more than
either you or I can understand.  Do you hear anything?  Do you
see any change in the water?</p>
          <p>We had now been about ten minutes upon the top of Helseggen,
to which we had ascended from the interior of Lofoden, so that
we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us 
from the summit.  As the old man spoke, I became aware of a
loud and gradually increasing sound, like the moaning of a vast
herd of buffaloes upon an American prairie; and at the same
moment I perceived that what seamen term the <hi rend="italics">chopping</hi> character
of the ocean beneath us, was rapidly changing into a current which
set to the eastward.  Even while I gazed, this current acquired a
monstrous velocity.  Each moment added to its speed—to its
headlong impetuosity.  In five minutes the whole sea, as far as
Vurrgh, was lashed into ungovernable fury; but it was between
Moskoe and the coast that the main uproar held its sway.  Here
the vast bed of the waters seamed and scarred into a thousand
conflicting channels, burst suddenly into phrensied convulsion—
heaving, boiling, hissing—gyrating in gigantic and innumerable
vortices, and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with
with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in
precipitous descents.</p>
          <p>In a few minutes more, there came over the scene another
radical alteration.  The general surface grew somewhat more
smooth, and the whirlpools, one by one, disappeared, while
prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had
been seen before.  These streaks, at length, spreading out to a
great distance, and entering into combination, took unto 
themselves the
<pb id="poe86" n="86"/>
gyratory motion of the subsided vortices, and seemed to form the
germ of another more vast.  Suddenly—very suddenly—this
assumed a distinct and definite existence, in a circle of more than
a mile in diameter.  The edge of the whirl was represented by a
broad belt of gleaming spray; but no particle of this slipped into the
mouth of the terrific funnel, whose interior, as far as the eye could
fathom it, was a smooth, shining, and jet-black wall of water,
inclined to the horizon at an angle of some forty-five degrees,
speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering
motion and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice, half
shriek, half roar, such as not even the mighty cataract of Niagara
ever lifts up in its agony to Heaven.</p>
          <p>The mountain trembled to its very base, and the rock rocked.  I
threw myself upon my face, and clung to the scant herbage in an
excess of nervous agitation.</p>
          <p>“This,” said I at length, to the old man—“this <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be nothing else
than the great whirlpool of the Maelström.”</p>
          <p>“So it is sometimes termed,” said he.  “We Norwegians call it the
Moskoe-ström, from the island of Moskoe in the midway.”</p>
          <p>The ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared
me for what I saw.  That of Jonas Ramus, which is perhaps the
most circumstantial of any, cannot impart the faintest conception
either of the magnificence, or of the horror of the scene—or of
the wild bewildering sense of <hi rend="italics">the novel</hi> which confounds the
beholder.  I am not sure from what point of view the writer in
question surveyed it, nor at what time; but it could neither have
been from the summit of Helseggen, nor during a storm.  There
are some passages of his description, nevertheless, which may
be quoted for their details, although their effect is exceedingly
feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle.</p>
          <p>“Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” he says, “the depth of the
water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms; but on the other
side toward Ver (Vurrgh) this depth decreases so as not to
afford a convenient passage for a vessel, without the risk of
splitting on the rocks, which happens even in the calmest
water.  When it is flood, the stream runs up the country between
Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous rapidity; but the roar
of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest
and most dreadful</p>
          <pb id="poe87" n="87"/>
          <p>cataracts; the noise being heard several leagues off, and the
vortices or pits are of such an extent and depth, that if a ship
comes within its attraction, it is inevitably absorbed and carried
down to the bottom, and there beat to pieces against the rocks;
and when the water relaxes, the fragments thereof are thrown up
again.  But these intervals of tranquility are only at the turn of the
ebb and flood, and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an
hour, its violence gradually returning.  When the stream is most
boisterous, and its fury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to
come within a Norway mile of it.  Boats, yachts, and ships have
been carried away by not guarding against it before they were
within its reach.  It likewise happens frequently, that whales
come too near the stream, and are overpowered by its violence;
and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and bellowings
in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves.  A bear once,
attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by
the stream and borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to
be heard on shore.  Large stocks of firs and pine trees, after
being absorbed by the current, rise again broken and torn to
such a degree as if bristles grew upon them.  This plainly shows
the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among which they are
whirled to and fro.  This stream is regulated by the flux and
reflux of the sea—it being constantly high and low water every
six hours.  In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima
Sunday, it raged with such a noise and impetuosity that the
very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground.”</p>
          <p>In regard to the depth of the water, I could not see how this
could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of
the vortex.  The “forty fathoms” must have reference only to
portions of the channel close upon the shore either of Moskoe
or Lofoden.  The depth in the centre of the Moskoe or 
Lofoden.  The depth in the centre of the Moskoe-ström must
be immeasurably greater; and no better proof of this fact is
necessary than can be obtained from even the sidelong glance
into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest
crag of Helseggen.  Looking down from this pinnacle upon the
howling Phlegethon below, I could not help smiling at the
simplicity with which the honest Jonas Ramus records, as a
matter difficult of belief, the anecdotes of the whales and the
bears; for it appeared
<pb id="poe88" n="88"/>
to me, in fact, a self-evident thing, that the largest ship of
the line in existence, coming within the influence of that deadly
attraction, could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane, and
must disappear bodily and at once.</p>
          <p>The attempts to account for the phenomenon—some of which, I
remember, seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal—now
wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect.  The idea generally
received is that this, as well as three smaller vortices among the
Ferroe islands, “have no other cause than the collision of waves
rising and falling, at flux and reflux, against a ridge of rocks and
shelves, which confines the water so that it precipitates itself like a
cataract; and thus the higher the flood rises, the deeper must the fall
be, and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex, the
prodigious suction of which is sufficiently known by lesser
experiments.” —These are the words of the Encyclopædia
Britannica. Kircher and others imagine that in the centre of the
channel of the Maelström is an abyss penetrating the globe, and
issuing in some very remote part—the Gulf of Bothnia being
somewhat decidedly named in one instance.  This opinion, idle in
itself, was the one to which, as I gazed, my imagination most readily
assented; and, mentioning it to the guide, I was rather surprised to
hear him say that, although it was the view almost universally
entertained of the subject by the Norwegians, it nevertheless
was not his own.  As to the former notion he confessed his inability to
comprehend it; and here I agreed with him—for, however conclusive
on paper, it becomes altogether unintelligible, and even absurd, amid
the thunder of the abyss.</p>
          <p>“You have had a good look at the whirl now,” said the old
man, “and if you will creep round this crag, so as to get in its lee,
and deaden the roar of the water, I will tell you a story that will
convince you I ought to know something of the Moskoe-ström.”</p>
          <p>I placed myself as desired, and he proceeded.</p>
          <p>“Myself and my two brothers once owned a schooner-rigged
smack of about seventy tons burthen, with which we were in the
habit of fishing among the islands beyond Moskoe, nearly to
Vurrgh.  In all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing, at
the proper opportunities, if one has only the courage to attempt it;
<pb id="poe89" n="89"/>
but among the whole of the Lofoden coastmen, we three were the
only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands,
as I tell you.  The usual grounds are a great way lower down to the
southward.  There fish can be got at all hours, without much risk,
and therefore these places are preferred.  The choice spots over here
among the rocks, however, not only yield the finest variety, but in
far greater abundance; so that we often got in a single day, what the
more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week.  In fact,
we made it a matter of desperate speculation—the risk of life
standing instead of labor, and courage answering for capital.</p>
          <p>“We kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast
than this; and it was our practice, in fine weather; to take advantage
of the fifteen minutes' slack to push across the main channel of the
Moskoe-ström, far above the pool, and then drop down upon
anchorage somewhere near Otterholm, or Sandflesen, where the
eddies are not so violent as elsewhere.  Here we used to remain until
nearly time for slack-water again, when we weighed and made for
home.  We never set out upon this expedition without a steady side
wind for going and coming—one that we felt sure would not fail us
before our return—and we seldom made a mis-calculation upon this
point.  Twice, during six years, we were forced to stay all night at
anchor on account of a dead calm, which is a rare thing indeed just
about here; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week,
starving to death, owing to a gale which blew up shortly after our
arrival, and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of.  Upon
this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of
everything, (for the whirlpools threw us round and round so
violently, that, at length, we fouled our anchor and dragged it) if it
had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross
currents—here today and gone to-morrow—which drove us under
the lee of Flimen, where, by good luck, we brought up.</p>
          <p>“I could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we
encountered ‘on the grounds’—it is a bad spot to be in, even in good
weather—but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the
Moskoe-ström itself without accident; although at times my heart
has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute
<pb id="poe90" n="90"/>
or so behind or before the slack.  The wind sometimes was not as
strong as we thought it at starting, and then we made rather less way
than we could wish, while the current rendered the smack
unmanageable.  My eldest brother had a son eighteen years old, and I
had two stout boys of my own.  These would have been of great
assistance at such times, in using the sweeps, as well as afterward in
fishing—but somehow, although we ran the risk ourselves, we had
not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger—for, after all
is said and done, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a horrible danger, and that is the truth.</p>
          <p>“It is now within a few days of three years since what I am going
to tell you occurred.  It was on the tenth day of July, 18--, a day
which the people of this part of the world will never forget—for it
was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out
of the heavens.  And yet all the morning, and indeed until late in the
afternoon, there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west,
while the sun shone brightly, so that the oldest seaman among us
could not have foreseen what was to follow.</p>
          <p>“The three of us—my two brothers and myself—had crossed
over to the islands about two o'clock P. M., and had soon nearly
loaded the smack with fine fish, which, we all remarked, were more
plenty that day than we had ever known them.  It was just seven, <hi rend="italics">by
my watch</hi>, when we weighed and started for home, so as to make the
worst of the Ström at slack water, which we knew would be at
eight.</p>
          <p>“We set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter, and for
some time spanked along at a great rate, never dreaming of danger,
for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it.  All
at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over Helseggen.
This was most unusual—something that had never happened to us
before—and I began to feel a little uneasy, without exactly
knowing why.  We put the boat on the wind, but could make no
headway at all for the eddies, and I was upon the point of proposing
to return to the anchorage, when, looking astern, we saw the whole
horizon covered with a singular copper-colored cloud that rose
with the most amazing velocity.</p>
          <p>“In the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away,
<pb id="poe91" n="91"/>
and we were dead becalmed, drifting about in every direction.  This
state of things, however, did not last long enough to give us time to
think about it.  In less than a minute the storm was upon us—in
less than two the sky was entirely overcast—and what with this
and the driving spray, it became suddenly so dark that we could not
see each other in the smack.</p>
          <p>“Such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing.
The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it.
We had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us; but, at
the first puff, both our masts went by the board as if they had been
sawed off—the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who
had lashed himself to it for safety.</p>
          <p>“Our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon
water.  It had a complete flush deck, with only a small hatch near the
bow, and this hatch it had always been our custom to batten
down when about to cross the Ström, by way of precaution against
the chopping seas.  But for this circumstance we should have
foundered at once—for we lay entirely buried for some moments.
How my elder brother escaped destruction I cannot say, for I never
had an opportunity of ascertaining.  For my part, as soon as I had let
the foresail run, I threw myself flat on deck, with my feet against the
narrow gunwale of the bow and with my hands grasping a ring-bolt
near the foot of the fore-mast.  It was mere instinct that prompted
me to do this—which was undoubtedly the very best thing I could
have done—for I was too much flurried to think.</p>
          <p>“For some moments we were completely deluged, as I say, and all
this time I held my breath, and clung to the bolt.  When I could stand
it no longer I raised myself upon my knees still keeping hold with
my hands, and thus got my head clear.  Presently our little boat
gave herself a shake, just as a dog does in coming out of the water,
and thus rid herself, in some measure, of the seas.  I was now
trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me, and to
collect my senses so as to see what was to be done, when I felt
somebody grasp my arm.  It was my elder brother, and my heart
leaped for joy, for I had made sure that he was overboard—but the
next moment all this joy was turned into
<pb id="poe92" n="92"/>
horror—for he put his mouth close to my ear, and screamed out the
word ‘<hi rend="italics">Moskoe-ström!</hi>’</p>
          <p>“No one ever will know what my feelings were at that moment.
I shook from head to foot as if I had had the most violent fit of the
ague.  I knew what he meant by that one word well enough—I
knew what he wished to make me understand.  With the wind that
now drove us on, we were bound for the whirl of the Ström, and
nothing could save us!</p>
          <p>“You perceive that in crossing the Ström <hi rend="italics">channel</hi>, we always
went a long way up above the whirl, even in the calmest weather,
and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack—but now we
were driving right upon the pool itself, and in such a hurricane as
this!  ‘To be sure,’ I thought, ‘we shall get there just about the
slack—there is some little hope in that’—but in the next moment
I cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of hope at all.
I knew very well that we were doomed, had we been ten times a
ninety-gun ship.</p>
          <p>“By this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself, or
perhaps we did not feel it so much, as we scudded before it, but at
all events the seas, which at first had been kept down by the wind,
and lay flat and frothing, now got up into absolute mountains.  A
singular change too, had come over the heavens.  Around in every
direction it was still as black as pitch, but nearly overhead there
burst out, all at once, a circular rift of clear sky—as clear as I
ever saw—and of a deep bright blue—and through it there blazed
forth the full moon with a lustre that I never before knew her to
wear.  She lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness
—but, oh God, what a scene it was to light up!</p>
          <p>“I now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother—but in some
manner which I could not understand, the din had so increased that I
could not make him hear a single word, although I screamed at the
top of my voice in his ear.  Presently he shook his head, looking as
pale as death, and held up one of his finger, as if to say ‘<hi rend="italics">listen!</hi>’</p>
          <p>“At first I could not make out what he meant—but soon a hideous
thought flashed upon me.  I dragged my watch from its fob.  It was
not going.  I glanced at its face, by the moonlight, and then burst
into tears as I flung it far away into the ocean
<pb id="poe93" n="93"/>
<hi rend="italics">It had run down at seven o'clock!  We were behind the time of the
slack, and the whirl of the Ström was in full fury!</hi></p>
          <p>“When a boat is well built, properly trimmed, and not deep laden,
the waves in a strong gale, when she is going large, seem always to
slip from beneath her—which appears very strange to a Landsman—
and this is what is called <hi rend="italics">riding</hi>, in sea phrase.  Well, so far
we had ridden the swells very cleverly; but presently a gigantic
sea happened to take us right under the counter, and bore us with it
as it rose—up—up—as if into the sky.  I would not have believed
that any wave could rise so high.  And then down we came with a
sweep, a slide, and a plunge, that made me feel sick and dizzy, as if I
was falling from some lofty mountain-top in a dream.  But while we
were up I had thrown a quick glance around—and that one glance
was all sufficient.  I saw our exact position in an instant.  The Moskoe-
Ström whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead—but no
more like the every-day Moskoe-Ström, than the whirl as you now
see it is like a mill-race.  If I had not known where we were, and what
we had to expect, I should not have recognised the place at all.  As it
was, I involuntarily closed my eyes in horror.  The lids clenched
themselves together as if in a spasm.</p>
          <p>“It could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we
suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The
boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new
direction like a thunderbolt.  At the same moment the roaring noise of
the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek—such a
sound as you might imagine given out by the waste pipes of many
thousand steam-vessels letting off their steam all together.  We were
now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I
thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the
abyss—down which we could only see indistinctly on account of
the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along. The boat did
not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble
upon the surface of the surge.  Her starboard side was next the whirl,
and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left.  It stood
like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.</p>
          <p>“It may appear strange, but now, when we were in the very
<pb id="poe94" n="94"/>
jaws of the gulf, I felt more composed than when we were only
approaching it.  Having made up my mind to hope no more, I got rid
of a great deal of that terror which unmanned me at first.  I suppose
it was despair that strung my nerves.</p>
          <p>“It may look like boasting—but what I tell you is truth—I began
to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner, and
how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as
my own individual life, in view of so wonderful a manifestation of
God's power.  I do believe that I blushed with shame when this idea
crossed my mind.  After a little while I became possessed with the
keenest curiosity about the whirl itself.  I positively felt a <hi rend="italics">wish</hi> to
explore its depths, even at the sacrifice I was going to make; and my
principal grief was that I should never be able to tell my old
companions on shore about the mysteries I should see.  These, no
doubt, were singular fancies to occupy a man's mind in such
extremity—and I have often thought since, that the revolutions of
the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little light-headed.</p>
          <p>“There was another circumstance which tended to restore my
self-possession; and this was the cessation of the wind, which could
not reach us in our present situation—for, as you saw yourself, the
belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean,
and this latter now towered above us, a high, black, mountainous
ridge. If you have never been at sea in a heavy gale, you can form
no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray
together. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away all
power of action or reflection.  But we were now, in a great measure,
rid of these annoyances—just us death-condemned felons in prison
are allowed petty indulgences, forbidden them while their doom is yet
uncertain.</p>
          <p>“How often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say.
We careered round and round for perhaps an hour, flying rather
than floating, getting gradually more and more into the middle of the
surge, and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge. All this
time I had never let go of the ring-bolt.  My brother was at the stern,
holding on to a small empty water-cask which had been securely
lashed under the coop of the counter and was the only thing on deck that
had not been swept overboard
<pb id="poe95" n="95"/>
when the gale first took us.  As we approached the brink of
the pit he let go his hold upon this, and made for the ring, from
which, in the agony of his terror, he endeavored to force my hands,
as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp.  I never
felt deeper grief than when I saw him attempt this act—although I
knew he was a madman when he did it—a raving maniac through
sheer fright.  I did not care, however, to contest the point with him.  I
knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all;
so I let him have the bolt, and went astern to the cask.  This there
was no great difficulty in doing; for the smack flew round steadily
enough, and upon an even keel—only swaying to and fro, with the
immense sweeps and swelters of the whirl.  Scarcely had I secured
myself in my new position, when we gave a wild lurch to starboard,
and rushed headlong into the abyss.  I muttered a hurried prayer to
God and thought all was over.</p>
          <p>“As I felt the sickening sweep of the descent, I had instinctively
tightened my hold upon the barrel, and closed my eyes.  For some
seconds I dared not open them—while I expected instant
destruction, and wondered that I was not already in my death-struggles
with the water. But moment after moment elapsed.  I still
lived.  The sense of falling had ceased; and the motion of the vessel
seemed much as it had been before, while in the belt of foam, with
the exception that she now lay more along.  I took courage, and
looked once again upon the scene.</p>
          <p>“Never shall I forget the sensations of awe, horror, and admiration
with which I gazed about me.  The boat appeared to be hanging, as if
by magic, midway down, upon the interior surface of a funnel vast
in circumference, prodigious in depth, and whose perfectly smooth
sides might have been mistaken for ebony, but for the bewildering
rapidity with which they spun around, and for the gleaming and
ghastly radiance they shot forth, as the rays of the full moon, from
that circular rift amid the clouds which I have already described,
streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls, and far
away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.</p>
          <p>“At first I was too much confused to observe anything accurately.
The general burst of terrific grandeur was all that I beheld.
<pb id="poe96" n="96"/>
When I recovered myself a little, however, my gaze fell
instinctively downward.  In this direction I was able to obtain an
unobstructed view, from the manner in which the smack hung on
the inclined surface of the pool.  She was quite upon an even keel
—that is to say, her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the
water—but this latter sloped at an angle of more than forty-five
degrees, so that we seemed to be lying upon our beam-ends.  I
could not help observing, nevertheless, that I had scarcely more
difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation,
than if we had been upon a dead level; and this, I suppose, was
owing to the speed at which we revolved.</p>
          <p>“The rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of
the profound gulf; but still I could make out nothing distinctly,
on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped,
and over which there hung a magnificent rainbow, like that narrow
and tottering bridge which Mussulmen say is the only pathway 
between Time and Eternity.  This mist, or spray, was no doubt
occasioned by the clashing of the great walls of the funnel, as they
all met together at the bottom—but the yell that went up to the
Heavens from out of that mist, I dare not attempt to describe.</p>
          <p>“Our first slide into the abyss itself, from the belt of foam
above, had carried us a great distance down the slope; but our
farther descent was by no means proportionate.  Round and
round we swept—not with any uniform movement—but in dizzying
swings and jerks, that sent us sometimes only a few hundred
yards—sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl.  Our
progress downward, at each revolution, was slow, but very perceptible.</p>
          <p>“Looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid ebony on
which we were thus borne, I perceived that our boat was not the
only object in the embrace of the whirl.  Both above and below
us were visible fragments of vessels, large masses of building 
timber and trunks of trees, with many smaller articles, such as pieces
of house furniture, broken boxes, barrels and staves.  I have
already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the
place of my original terrors.  It appeared to grow upon me as I
drew nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom.  I now began to
<pb id="poe97" n="97"/>
watch, with a strange interest, the numerous things that floated in
our company.  I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have been delirious—for I even sought
<hi rend="italics">amusement</hi> in speculating upon the relative velocities of their 
several descents toward the foam below.  ‘This fir tree,’ I found
myself at one time saying, ‘will certainly be the next thing that takes
the awful plunge and disappears,’—and then I was disappointed to
find that the wreck of a Dutch merchant ship overtook it and went
down before.  At length, after making several guesses of this nature,
and being deceived in all—this fact—the fact of my invariable
miscalculation—set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs
again tremble, and my heart beat heavily once more.</p>
          <p>“It was not a new terror that thus affected me, but the dawn of a
more exciting <hi rend="italics">hope</hi>.  This hope arose partly from memory, and partly
from present observation.  I called to mind the great variety of
buoyant matter that strewed the coast of Lofoden having been
absorbed and then thrown forth by the Moskoe-ström.  By far the
greater number of the articles were shattered in the most
extraordinary way—so chafed and roughened as to have the
appearance of being stuck full of splinters—but then I distinctly
recollected that there were <hi rend="italics">some</hi> of them which were not disfigured
at all.  Now I could not account for this difference except by
supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which
had been <hi rend="italics">completely absorbed</hi>—that the others had entered the whirl
at so late a period of the tide, or, for some reason, had descended so
slowly after entering, that they did not reach the bottom before the
turn of the flood came, or of the ebb as the case might be.  I
conceived it possible, in either instance, that they might thus be
whirled up again to the level of the ocean, without undergoing the
fate of those which had been drawn in more early, or absorbed more
rapidly.  I made, also three important observations.  The first was,
that, as a general rule, the larger the bodies were, the more rapid their
descent—the second, that, between two masses of equal extent, the
one spherical, and the other of <hi rend="italics">any other shape</hi>, the superiority in
speed of descent was with the spheres—the third, that, between two
masses of equal size, the one cylindrical, and the other of
any other shape, the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly.
<pb id="poe98" n="98"/>
Since my escape, I have had several conversations on this subject
with an old school-master of the district; and it was from him that I
learned the use of the words ‘cylinder’ and ‘sphere.’  He explained to
me—although I have forgotten the explanation— how what I
observed was, in fact, the natural consequence of the forms of the
floating fragments and showed me how it happened that a cylinder,
swimming in a vortex, offered more resistance to its suction, and
was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body, of
any form whatever.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" target="note2">*</ref></p>
          <p>“There was one startling circumstance which went a great way in
enforcing these observations, and rendering me anxious to turn them
to account, and this was that, at every revolution, we passed
something like a barrel, or else the yard or the mast of a vessel,
while many of these things, which had been on our level when I first
opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool, were now high
up above us, and seemed to have moved but little from their original
station.</p>
          <p>“I no longer hesitated what to do.  I resolved to lash myself
securely to the water cask upon which I now held, to cut it loose
from the counter, and to throw myself with it into the water.  I
attracted my brother's attention by signs, pointed to the floating
barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make
him understand what I was about to do.  I thought at length that he
comprehended my design—but, whether this was the case or not,
he shook his head despairingly, and refused to move from his 
station by the ring-bolt.  It was impossible to reach him; the 
emergency admitted of no delay; and so, with a bitter struggle, I
resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to the cask by means of
the lashings which secured it to the counter, and precipitated
myself with it into the sea, without another moment's hesitation.</p>
          <p>“The result was precisely what I had hoped it might be.  As it is
myself who now tell you this tale—as you see that I <hi rend="italics">did</hi>
escape—and as you are already in possession of the mode in which
this escape was effected, and must therefore anticipate all that I
have farther to say—I will bring my story quickly to conclusion. 
It might have been an hour, or thereabout, after my
<note id="note2" n="2" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">*See Archimedes, “<foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">De Incidentibus in Fluido.</hi></foreign>” --lib. 2.</note>
<pb id="poe99" n="99"/>
quitting the smack, when, having descended to a vast distance
beneath me, it made three or four wild gyrations in rapid succession,
and, bearing my loved brother with it, plunged headlong, at once and
forever, into the chaos of foam below.  The barrel to which I was
attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the
bottom of the gulf and the spot at which I leaped overboard, before a
great change took place in the character of the whirlpool.  The slope
of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep.
The gyrations of the whirl grew, gradually, less and less violent.  By
degrees, the froth and the rainbow disappeared, and the bottom of
the gulf seemed slowly to uprise.  The sky was clear, the winds had
gone down, and the full moon was setting radiantly in the west, when
I found myself on the surface of the ocean, in full view of the shores
of Lofoden, and above the spot where the pool of the Moskoe-ström
<hi rend="italics">had been</hi>.  It was the hour of the slack—but the sea still heaved in
mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane.  I was borne
violently into the channel of the Ström, and in a few minutes was
hurried down the coast into the ‘grounds’ of the fishermen.  A boat
picked me up exhausted from fatigue—and (now that the danger was
removed) speechless from the memory of its horror.  Those who
drew me on board were my old mates and daily companions—but
they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from
the spirit-land.  My hair which had been raven black the day before,
was as white as you see it now.  They say too that the whole
expression of my countenance had changed.  I told them my
story—they did not believe it.  I now tell it to <hi rend="italics">you</hi>—and I can
scarcely expect you to put more faith in it than did the merry
fishermen of Lofoden.“</p>

          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos.</hi>  Yes, fairest and best beloved Una, “born again.”
These were the words upon whose mystical meaning I had so
long pondered, rejecting the explanations of the priesthood, until
Death himself resolved for me the secret.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una.</hi>  Death!</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos.</hi>  How strangely, sweet Una, you echo my words! I
observe, too, a vacillation in your step—a joyous inquietude in
your eyes.  You are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty
of the Life Eternal.  Yes, it was of Death I spoke.  And here how
singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror
to all hearts—throwing a mildew upon all pleasures!</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una. </hi> Ah, Death, the spectre which sate at all feasts!  How
often, Monos, did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its 
nature!  How mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss—
saying unto it “thus far, and no farther!”  That earnest mutual love,
my own Monos, which burned within our bosoms how vainly did
we flatter ourselves, feeling happy in its first up-springing, that our
happiness would strengthen with its strength!  Alas! as it grew, so
grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying
to separate us forever!  Thus, in time, it became painful to love.
Hate would have been mercy then.</p>
          <pb id="poe101" n="101"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos. </hi>Speak not here of these griefs, dear Una—mine, mine,
forever now!</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una. </hi> But the memory of past sorrow—is it not present joy?
I have much to say yet of the things which have been.  Above all,
I burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark
Valley and Shadow.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos. </hi> And when did the radiant Una ask anything of her
Monos in vain?  I will be minute in relating all—but at what
point shall the weird narrative begin?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una.</hi>  At what point?</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos.</hi>  You have said.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una.</hi>  Monos, I comprehend you.  In Death we have both
learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable.  I will
not say, then, commence with the moment of life's cessation—but commence with that sad, sad instant when, the fever having
abandoned you, you sank into a breathless and motionless torpor,
and I pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers
of love.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos.</hi>  One word first, my Una, in regard to man's general
condition at this epoch.  You will remember that one or two of
the wise among our forefathers—wise in fact, although not in the
world's esteem—had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term
“improvement,” as applied to the progress of our civilization.  There
were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately
preceding our dissolution, when arose some vigorous intellect,
boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now, to
our disenfranchised reason, so utterly obvious—principles which
should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural
laws, rather than attempt their control.  At long intervals some
masterminds appeared, looking upon each advance in practical
science as a retro-gradation in the true utility.  Occasionally the
poetic intellect—that intellect which we now feel to have been the
most exalted of all—since those truths which to us were of the most
enduring importance could only be reached by that <hi rend="italics">analogy</hi> which
speaks in proof tones to the imagination alone and to the unaided
reason bears no weight—occasionally did this poetic intellect
proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the
philosophic, and find in the mystic parable that tells
<pb id="poe102" n="102"/>
of the tree of knowledge, and of its forbidden fruit, death-producing,
a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man
in the infant condition of his soul.  And these men—the poets -
living and perishing amid the scorn of the “utilitarians”—of rough
pedants, who arrogated to themselves a title which could have been
properly applied only to the scorned—these men, the poets,
pondered piningly, yet not unwisely, upon the ancient days when
our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen—
days when <hi rend="italics">mirth</hi> was a word unknown, so solemnly deep-toned
was happiness—holy, august and blissful days, when blue rivers ran
undammed, between hills unhewn, into far forest solitudes, primæval,
odorous, and unexplored.</p>
          <p>Yet these noble exceptions from the general misrule served but to
strengthen it by opposition.  Alas! we had fallen upon the most evil
of all our evil days.  The great “movement”—that was the cant
term—went on: a diseased commotion, moral and physical.
Art—the Arts—arose supreme, and, once enthroned, cast chains
upon the intellect which had elevated them to power.  Man, because
he could not but acknowledge the majesty of Nature, fell into
childish exultation at his acquired and still-increasing dominion
over her elements.  Even while he stalked a God in his own fancy,
an infantine imbecility came over him.  As might be supposed from
the origin of his disorder, he grew infected with system, and with
abstraction.  He enwrapped himself in generalities.  Among other
odd ideas, that of universal equality gained ground; and in the face
of analogy and of God—in despite of the loud warning voice of
the laws of <hi rend="italics">gradation</hi> so visibly pervading all things in Earth an
Heaven—wild attempts at an omni-prevalent Democracy were
made.  Yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil,
Knowledge.  Man could not both know and succumb.  Meantime
huge smoking cities arose, innumerable.  Green leaves shrank
before the hot breath of furnaces.  The fair face of Nature was
deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease.  And methinks,
sweet Una, even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the
far-fetched might have arrested us here.  But now it appears
that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of
our <hi rend="italics">taste</hi>, or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the
<pb id="poe103" n="103"/>
schools.  For, in truth, it was at this crisis that taste alone—that
faculty which, holding a middle position between the pure intellect
and the moral sense, could never safely have been disregarded—it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to
Beauty, to Nature, and to Life.  But alas for the pure contemplative
spirit and majestic intuition of Plato!  Alas for the <foreign lang="gre">μουσικη</foreign> which he
justly regarded as an all-sufficient education for the soul!  Alas for
him and for it!—since both were most desperately needed when
both were most entirely forgotten or despised.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" target="note3">*</ref></p>
          <p>Pascal, a philosopher whom we both love, has said, how truly!—
“<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">que tout
notre raisonnement se rèduit à céder au
sentiment</hi></foreign>;” and
it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural, had time
permitted it, would have regained its old ascendancy over the harsh
mathematical reason of the schools.  But this thing was not to be.
Prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge the old age of
the world drew on.  This the mass of mankind saw not, or, living
lustily although unhappily, affected not to see.  But, for myself, the
Earth's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of
highest civilization.  I had imbibed a prescience of our Fate from
comparison of China the simple and enduring, with Assyria the
architect, with Egypt the astrologer, with Nubia, more crafty than
either, the turbulent mother of all Arts.  In history<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" target="note4">†</ref> of these regions I met with a ray
from the 
<note id="note3" n="3" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">*“It will be
hard to discover a better [method of education] than that
which the experience of so many ages has already discovered; and this
may be summed up as consisting in gymnastics for the body, and <hi rend="italics">music</hi>
for the soul.” —Repub. lib. 2.  “For this reason is a
musical education
most essential; since. it causes Rhythm and Harmony to penetrate most
intimately into the soul, taking the strongest hold upon it, filling it
with <hi rend="italics">beauty</hi> and making the man <hi rend="italics">beautiful-minded</hi> . . . . .  He will praise and
admire <hi rend="italics">the beautiful</hi>; will receive it with joy
into his soul, will feed
upon it, and <hi rend="italics">assimilate his own condition with
it</hi>.”—Ibid. lib. 3.
Music (<foreign lang="gre">μουσικη</foreign>)
had, however, among the Athenians, a far more comprehensive
signification than with us.  It included not only the harmonies of time
and of tune, but the poetic diction, sentiment and creation, each in its
widest sense.  The study of <hi rend="italics">music</hi> was with them,
in fact, the general
cultivation of the taste—of that which recognizes the beautiful—in
contra-distinction from reason, which deals only with the true.</note>

<pb id="poe104" n="104"/>
Future. The individual artificialities of the three latter were local
diseases of the Earth, and in their individual overthrows we had seen
local remedies applied; but for the infected world at large I could
anticipate no regeneration save in death.  That man, as a race, should
not become extinct, I saw that he must be “<hi rend="italics">born
again</hi>.”</p>
          <p>And now it was, fairest and dearest, that we wrapped our spirits,
daily, in dreams.  Now it was that, in twilight, we discoursed of
the days to come, when the Art-scarred surface of the Earth, having
undergone that purification<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" target="note5">*</ref> which alone could efface its rectangular
obscenities, should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the
mountain-slopes and the smiling waters of Paradise, and be rendered
at length a fit dwelling-place for man:—for man the Death
purged—for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be
poison in knowledge no more—for the redeemed, regenerated,
blissful, and now immortal, but still for the <hi rend="italics">material</hi>, man.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Una.</hi>  Well do I remember these conversations,
dear Monos; but
the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we
believed, and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us
in believing.  Men lived; and died individually.  You yourself
sickened, and passed into the grave; and thither your constant Una
speedily followed you.  And though the century which has since
elapsed, and whose conclusion brings us thus together once
more, tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of
duration, yet, my Monos, it was a century still.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Monos.</hi>  Say, rather, a point in the vague
infinity.  Unquestionably,
it was in the Earth's dotage that I died.  Wearied at heart with
anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay,
I succumbed to the fierce fever.  After some few days of pain, and
many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy, the manifestations
of which you mistook for pain, while I longed but was impotent to
undeceive you—after some days there came upon me, as you have
said, a breathless and motionless torpor; and this was termed <hi rend="italics">Death</hi>
by those who stood around me.</p>
          <p>Words are vague things.  My condition did not deprive me of
<note id="note5" n="5" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">*The word
“purification” seems here to be used with—reference to
its root in the Greek <foreign lang="gre">πυρ</foreign>, fire.</note>
<pb id="poe105" n="105"/>
sentience.  It appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme
quiescence of him, who, having slumbered long and profoundly,
lying motionless and fully prostrate in a midsummer noon, begins to
steal slowly back into consciousness, through the mere sufficiency
of his sleep, and without being awakened by  external disturbances.</p>
          <p>I breathed no longer.  The pulses were still.  The heart had ceased to
beat.  Volition had not departed, but was powerless.  The senses were
unusually active, although eccentrically so—assuming often each
other's functions at random.  The taste and the smell were
inextricably confounded, and became one sentiment, abnormal and
intense.  The rose-water with which your tenderness had moistened
my lips to the last, affected me with sweet fancies of
flowers—fantastic flowers, far more lovely than any of the old
Earth, but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us.
The eyelids, transparent and bloodless, offered no complete
impediment to vision.  As volition was in abeyance, the balls could
not roll in their sockets but all objects within the range of the visual
hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness; the rays which
fell upon the external retina, or into the corner of the eye, producing
a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior
surface.  Yet, in the former instance, this effect was so far anomalous
that I appreciated it only as <hi rend="italics">sound</hi>—sound sweet or discordant as
the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in
shade—curved or angular in outline.  The hearing, at the same time,
although excited in degree, was not irregular in action—estimating
real sounds with an extravagance of precision, not less than of 
sensibility.  Touch had undergone a modification more peculiar.  Its
impressions were tardily received, but pertinaciously retained, and
resulted always in the highest physical pleasure.  Thus the pressure
of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids, at first only recognised
through vision, at length, long after their removal, filled my whole
being with a sensual delight immeasurable.  I say with a sensual
delight.  <hi rend="italics">All</hi> my perceptions were purely sensual.  The materials
furnished the passive brain by the senses were not in the least degree
wrought into shape by the deceased understanding.  Of pain there
was some little; of pleasure there was
<pb id="poe106" n="106"/>
much; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all.  Thus your wild sobs
floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences, and were
appreciated in their every variation of sad tone; but they were soft
musical sounds and no more; they conveyed to the extinct reason no
intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth; while the large and
constant tears which fell upon my face, telling the bystanders of a
heart which broke, thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy
alone.  And this was in truth the <hi rend="italics">Death</hi> of which these bystanders
spoke reverently, in low whispers—you, sweet Una, gaspingly,
with loud cries.</p>
          <p>They attired me for the coffin—three or four dark figures which
flitted busily to and fro.  As these crossed the direct line of my vision
they affected me as <hi rend="italics">forms</hi>; but upon passing to my side their images
impressed me with the idea of shrieks, groans, and other dismal
expressions of terror, of horror, or of wo.  You alone, habited in a
white robe, passed in all directions musically about me.</p>
          <p>The day waned; and, as its light faded away, I became possessed
by a vague uneasiness—an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when
sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear—low distant
bell-tones, solemn, at long but equal intervals, and  mingling with
melancholy dreams.  Night arrived; and with its shadows a heavy
discomfort.  It oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some
dull weight, and was palpable.  There was also a moaning sound, not
unlike the distant reverberation of surf, but more continuous, which,
beginning with the first twilight, had grown in strength with the
darkness.  Suddenly lights were brought into the room, and this
reverberation became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal
bursts of the same sound, but less dreary and less distinct.  The
ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved; and, issuing
from the flame of each lamp, (for there were many,) there flowed
unbrokenly into my ears a strain of melodious monotone.  And when
now, dear Una, approaching the bed upon which I lay outstretched,
you sat gently by my side, breathing odor from your sweet lips, and
pressing them upon my brow, there arose tremulously within my bosom,
and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances
had called forth, a something akin to sentiment itself—a
<pb id="poe107" n="107"/>
feeling that, half appreciating, half responded to your earnest love
and sorrow; but this feeling took no root in the pulseless heart, and
seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality, and faded quickly
away, first into extreme quiescence, and then into a purely sensual
pleasure as before.</p>
          <p>And now, from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses, there
appeared to have arisen within me a sixth, all perfect.  In its exercise
I found a wild delight—yet a delight still physical, inasmuch as the
understanding had in it no part.  Motion in the animal frame had
fully ceased.  No muscle quivered; no nerve thrilled; no artery
throbbed.  But there seemed to have sprung up in the brain, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> of
which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even
an indistinct conception.  Let me term it a mental pendulous
pulsation.  It was the moral embodiment of man's abstract idea of
<hi rend="italics">Time</hi>.  By the absolute equalization of this movement—or of such as
this—had the cycles of the firmamental orbs themselves, been
adjusted.  By its aid I measured the irregularities of the clock upon
the mantel, and of the watches of the attendants.  Their tickings came
sonorously to my ears.  The slightest deviations from the true
proportion—and these deviations were omni-prævalent—affected
me just as violations of abstract truth were wont, on earth, to affect
the moral sense.  Although no two of the time-pieces in the chamber
struck the  individual seconds accurately together, yet I had no
difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones, and the respective
momentary errors of each.  And this—this keen, perfect, self-existing
sentiment of <hi rend="italics">duration</hi>—this sentiment existing (as man could not
possibly have conceived it to exist) independently of any succession of
events—this idea—this sixth sense, upspringing from the ashes of
the rest, was the first obvious and certain step of the intemporal
soul upon the threshold of the temporal Eternity.</p>
          <p>It was midnight; and you still sat by my side.  All others had
departed from the chamber of Death.  They had deposited me in the
coffin.  The lamps burned flickeringly; for this I knew by the
tremulousness of the monotonous strains.  But, suddenly these
strains diminished in distinctness and in volume.  Finally they
ceased.  The perfume in my nostrils died away.  Forms affected my
vision no longer.  The oppression of the Darkness
<pb id="poe108" n="108"/>
uplifted itself from my bosom.  A dull shock like that of electricity
pervaded my frame, and was followed by total loss of the idea of
contact.  All of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole
consciousness of entity, and in the one abiding sentiment of
duration.  The mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand
of the deadly <hi rend="italics">Decay</hi>.</p>
          <p>Yet had not all of sentience departed; for the consciousness and
the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a
lethargic intuition.  I appreciated the direful change now in operation
upon the flesh, and, as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily
presence of one who leans over him, so, sweet Una, I still dully felt
that you sat by my side.  So, too, when the noon of the second day
came, I was not unconscious of those movements which displaced
you from my side, which confined me within the coffin, which
deposited me within the hearse, which bore me to the grave, which
lowered me within it, which heaped heavily the mould upon me, and
which thus left me, in blackness and corruption, to my sad and
solemn slumbers with the worm.</p>
          <p>And here, in the prison-house which has few secrets to disclose,
there rolled away days and weeks and months; and the soul
watched narrowly each second as it flew, and, without effort, took
record of its flight—without effort and without object.</p>
          <p>A year passed.  The consciousness of <hi rend="italics">being</hi> had grown hourly
more indistinct, and that of mere <hi rend="italics">locality</hi> had, in great measure,
usurped its position.  The idea of entity was becoming merged in
that of <hi rend="italics">place</hi>.  The narrow space immediately surrounding what had
been the body, was now growing to be the body itself.  At length, as
often happens to the sleeper (by sleep and its world alone is <hi rend="italics">Death</hi>
imaged)—at length, as sometimes happened on Earth to the deep
slumberer, when some flitting light half startled him into awaking,
yet left him half enveloped in dreams—so to me, in the strict
embrace of the <hi rend="italics">Shadow</hi> came that light which alone might have had
power to startle—<hi rend="italics">the</hi> light of enduring <hi rend="italics">Love</hi>.  Men toiled at the
grave in which I lay darkling.  They upthrew the damp earth. Upon
my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of Una.</p>
          <p>And now again all was void.  That nebulous light had been
extinguished.  That feeble thrill had vibrated itself into 
<pb id="poe109" n="109"/>
quiescence.  Many <foreign rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">lustra</hi></foreign> had supervened.  Dust had returned to dust.
The worm had food no more.  The sense of being had at length
utterly departed, and there reigned in its stead—instead of all
things—dominant and perpetual—the autocrats <hi rend="italics">Place</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Time</hi>.  For
<hi rend="italics">that</hi> which <hi rend="italics">was not</hi>—for that which had no form—for that which
had no thought—for that which had no sentience—for that which
was soulless, yet of which matter formed no  portion—for all this
nothingness, yet for all this immortality, the grave was still a
home, and the corrosive hours, co-mates.</p>

          <p>Dreams are with us no more;—but of these mysteries anon.  I
rejoice to see you looking life-like and rational.  The film of the
shadow has already passed from off your eyes.  Be of heart and
fear nothing.  Your allotted days of stupor have expired and,

            <l>EIROS.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>True—I feel no stupor—none at all.  The wild sickness and the
terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no longer that mad,
rushing, horrible sound, like the “voice of many waters.”  Yet my
senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the keenness of their
perception of<hi rend="italics"> the new</hi>.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>CHARMION</l>
          </lg>
          <p>A few days will remove all this;—but I fully understand you,
and feel for you.  It is now ten earthly years since I underwent
<pb id="poe111" n="111"/>
what you undergo—yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still.
You have now suffered all of pain, however, which you will suffer
in Aidenn.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>EIROS.</l>
          </lg>

          </lg>
          <p>Oh God!—pity me, Charmion!—I am overburthened with the
majesty of all things—of the unknown now known—of the 
speculative Future merged in the august and certain Present.</p>
          <p>CHARMION</p>
          <p>Grapple not now with such thoughts.  To-morrow we will speak
of this.  Your mind wavers, and its agitation will find relief in the
exercise of simple memories.  Look not around, nor forward—but
back.  I am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that
stupendous event which threw you among us.  Tell me of it.  Let us
converse of familiar things, in the old familiar language of the world
which has so fearfully perished.</p>
          <lg>

          <p>Dreams are no more.  Was I much mourned, my Eiros?</p>
          <lg>
            <l>EIROS.</l>

hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your
household.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>CHARMION</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And that last hour—speak of it.  Remember that, beyond the
naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing.  When, coming
out from among mankind, I passed into Night through the
Grave—at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity which
overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated.  But, indeed, I knew
little of the speculative philosophy of the day.</p>
          <lg>
            <l>EIROS.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The individual calamity was as you say entirely unanticipated;
<pb id="poe112" n="112"/>
but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion
with astronomers.  I need scarce tell you, my friend, that,
even when you left us, men had agreed to understand those passages
in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all
things by fire, as having reference to the orb of the earth alone.  But
in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin, speculation had been at
fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the
comets were divested of the terrors of flame.  The very moderate
density of these bodies had been well established.  They had been
observed to pass among the satellites of Jupiter, without bringing
about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of
these secondary planets.  We had long regarded the wanderers as
vapory creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether
incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event
of contact.  But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the elements
of all the comets were accurately known.  That among them we should
look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been
for many years considered an inadmissible idea.  But wonders and
wild fancies had been, of late days, strangely rife among mankind;
and, although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual
apprehension prevailed, upon the announcement by astronomers of a
<hi rend="italics">new</hi> comet, yet this announcement was generally received with I
know not what of agitation and mistrust.</p>
          <p>The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, and
it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at perihelion,
would bring it into very close proximity with the earth.  There were
two or three astronomers, of secondary note, who resolutely
maintained that a contact was inevitable.  I cannot very well
express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people.  For a
few short days they would not believe an assertion which their
intellect so long employed among worldly considerations could not in
any manner grasp.  But the truth of a vitally important fact soon makes
its way into the understanding of even the most stolid.  Finally, all
men saw that astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet.
Its approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its appearance of
<pb id="poe113" n="113"/>
very unusual character.  It was of a dull red, and had little perceptible
train.  For seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its
apparent diameter, and but a partial alteration in its color.  Meantime,
the ordinary affairs of men were discarded and all interests absorbed
in a growing discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to
the cometary nature.  Even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish
capacities to such considerations.  The learned <hi rend="italics">now</hi> gave their intellect
—their soul—to no such points as the allaying of fear, or to
the sustenance of loved theory.  They sought—they panted for right
views.  They groaned for perfected knowledge.  <hi rend="italics">Truth</hi> arose in the
purity of her strength and exceeding majesty, and the wise bowed
down and adored.</p>
          <p>That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result
from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which hourly lost
ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely permitted to
rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd.  It was demonstrated, that
the density of the comet's <hi rend="italics">nucleus</hi> was far less than that of our rarest
gas; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites
of Jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon, and which served
greatly to allay terror.  Theologists with an earnestness fear-enkindled,
dwelt upon the biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the
people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous
instance had been known.  That the final destruction of the earth
must be brought about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit
that enforced every where conviction; and that the comets were of no
fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved all, in
a great measure, from the apprehension of the great calamity
foretold.  It is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors
in regard to pestilences and wars—errors which were wont to prevail
upon every appearance of a comet—were now altogether unknown.
As if by some sudden convulsive exertion, reason had at once hurled
superstition from her throne.  The feeblest intellect had derived vigor
from excessive interest.</p>
          <p>What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of
elaborate question.  The learned spoke of slight geological 
disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and consequently in
vegetation, of possible magnetic and electric influences.  Many
<pb id="poe114" n="114"/>
held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be
produced.  While such discussions were going on, their subject gradually
approached, growing larger in apparent diameter, and of a more
brilliant lustre.  Mankind grew paler as it came.  All human operations
were suspended.</p>
          <p>There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the
comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of any previously
recorded visitation.  The people now, dismissing any lingering hope that
the astronomers were wrong, experienced all the certainty of evil.  The
chimerical aspect of their terror was gone.  The hearts of the stoutest of
our race beat violently within their bosoms.  A very few days sufficed,
however, to merge even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable
We could no longer apply to the strange orb any <hi rend="italics">accustomed</hi> thoughts.
Its <hi rend="italics">historical</hi> attributes had disappeared.  It oppressed us with a hideous
<hi rend="italics">novelty</hi> of emotion.  We saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in
the heavens, but as an incubus upon our hearts, and a shadow upon our
brains.  It had taken, with inconceivable rapidity, the character of a
gigantic mantle of rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon.</p>
          <p>Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom.  It was clear
that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet we lived.  We
even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind.  The
exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent; for all
heavenly objects were plainly visible through it.  Meantime, our
vegetation had perceptibly altered; and we gained faith, from this
predicted circumstance, in the foresight of the wise.  A wild luxuriance
of foliage, utterly unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable
thing.</p>
          <p>Yet another day—and the evil was not altogether upon us.  It was
now evident that its nucleus would first reach us.  A wild change had
come over all men; and the first sense of <hi rend="italics">pain</hi> was the wild signal for
general lamentation and horror.  This first sense of pain lay in a
rigorous constriction of the breast and lungs, and an insufferable
dryness of the skin.  It could not be denied that our atmosphere was
radically affected; the conformation of this atmosphere and the
possible modifications to which it might be subjected, were
now the topics of discussion.  The result
<pb id="poe115" n="115"/>
of investigation sent an electric thrill of the intensest terror
through the universal heart of man.</p>
          <p>It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a
compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of twenty-
one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen in every one
hundred of the atmosphere.  Oxygen, which was the principle of
combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely necessary to the
support of animal life, and was the most powerful and energetic agent
in nature.  Nitrogen, on the contrary, was incapable of supporting either
animal life or flame.  An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had
been ascertained in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had
latterly experienced.  It was the pursuit, the extension of the idea,
which had engendered awe.  What would be the result of <hi rend="italics">a total
extraction of the nitrogen?</hi>  A combustion irresistible, all-devouring,
omni-prevalent, immediate;—the entire fulfilment, in all their minute
and terrible details, of the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of
the prophecies of the Holy Book.</p>
          <p>Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of mankind?
That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with hope,
was now the source of the bitterness of despair.  In its impalpable
gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of Fate.
Meantime a day again passed—bearing away with it the last shadow of
Hope.  We gasped in the rapid modification of the air.  The red blood
bounded tumultuously through its strict channels.  A furious delirium
possessed all men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the
threatening heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud.  But the nucleus
of the destroyer was now upon us;—even here in Aidenn, I shudder
while I speak.  Let me be brief—brief as the ruin that overwhelmed.
For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, visiting and penetrating
all things.  Then—let us bow down Charmion, before the excessive majesty
of the great God!—then, there came a shouting and pervading sound, as
if from the mouth itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether
in which we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for
whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels in the
high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.  Thus ended all.</p>

          <p>The mental features discoursed of as the analytical, are, in
themselves, but little susceptible of analysis.  We appreciate them only
in their effects.  We know of them, among other things, that they are
always to their possessor, when inordinately possessed, a source of the
liveliest enjoyment.  As the strong man exults in his physical ability,
delighting in such exercises as call his muscles into action, so glories the

mathematical study, and especially by that highest branch of it which,
unjustly, and merely on account of its retrograde operations, has been
called, as if <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>, analysis.  Yet to calculate is not in itself
to analyse.  A chess-player, for example, does the one without effort at
the other.  It follows that the game of chess, in its effects upon mental
character, is greatly misunderstood.  I am not now writing a treatise, but
simply prefacing a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations
very much at random;

I will, therefore, take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the
reflective intellect are more decidedly and more usefully tasked by the
unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of
chess.  In this latter, where the pieces have different and <hi rend="italics">bizarre</hi>
motions, with various and variable values, what is only complex is
mistaken (a not unusual error) for what is profound.  The <hi rend="italics">attention</hi> is
here called powerfully into play.  If it flag for an instant, an oversight
is committed resulting in injury or defeat.  The possible moves being not
only manifold but involute, the chances of such oversights are
multiplied; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more concentrative
rather than the more acute player who conquers.  In draughts, on
the contrary, where the moves are <hi rend="italics">unique</hi> and have but little
variation, the probabilities of inadvertence are diminished, and
the mere attention being left comparatively unemployed, what
advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior
<hi rend="italics">acumen</hi>.  To be less abstract—Let us suppose a game of draughts where
the pieces are reduced to four kings, and where, of course, no
oversight is to be expected.  It is obvious that here the victory can be
decided (the players being at all equal) only by some <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">recherché</hi></foreign>
movement, the result of some strong exertion of the intellect.
Deprived of ordinary resources, the analyst throws himself into the
spirit of his opponent, identifies himself therewith, and not unfrequently
sees thus, at a glance, the sole methods (sometime indeed absurdly
simple ones) by which he may seduce into error or hurry into
miscalculation.</p>
          <p>Whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the
calculating power; and men of the highest order of intellect have been
known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it, while
eschewing chess as frivolous.  Beyond doubt there is nothing of a
similar nature so greatly tasking the faculty of analysis.  The best
chess-player in Christendom <hi rend="italics">may</hi> be little more than the best player
of chess; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in
all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with
mind.  When I say proficiency, I mean that perfection in the game
which includes a comprehension of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the sources whence legitimate
advantage may be derived.  These are not only manifold but multiform,
and lie frequently
<pb id="poe118" n="118"/>
among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary
understanding.  To observe attentively is to remember distinctly; and,
so far, the concentrative chess-player will do very well at whist;
while the rules of Hoyle (themselves based upon the mere mechanism
of the game) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible.  Thus to
have a retentive memory, and to proceed by “the book,” are points
commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing.  But it is in
matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the analyst is
evinced.  He makes, in silence, a host of observations and inferences.
So, perhaps, do his companions; and the difference in the extent of
the information obtained, lies not so much in the validity of the
inference as in the quality of the observation.  The necessary
knowledge is that of <hi rend="italics">what</hi> to observe.  Our player confines himself not
at all; nor, because the game is the object, does he reject deductions
from things external to the game.  He examines the countenance of his
partner, comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents.  He
considers the mode of assorting the cards in each hand; often counting
trump by trump, and honor by honor, through the glances bestowed
by their holders upon each.  He notes every variation of face as the
play progresses, gathering a fund of thought from the differences in
the expression of certainty, of surprise, of triumph, or of chagrin.
From the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person
taking it can make another in the suit.  He recognises what is played
through feint, by the air with which it is thrown upon the table.  A
casual or inadvertent word; the accidental dropping or turning of a
card, with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its
concealment; the counting of the tricks, with the order of their
arrangement; embarrassment, hesitation, eagerness or trepidation—all
afford, to his apparently intuitive perception, indications of the true
state of affairs.  The first two or three rounds having been played, he
is in full possession of the contents of each hand, and thenceforward
puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the
rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own.</p>
          <p>The analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity;
for while the analyst is necessarily ingenious, the ingenious
<pb id="poe119" n="119"/>
man is often remarkably incapable of analysis.  The constructive or
combining power, by which ingenuity is usually manifested, and to
which the phrenologists (I believe erroneously) have assigned a
separate organ, supposing it a primitive faculty, has been so
frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon
idiocy, as to have attracted general observation among writers on
morals.  Between ingenuity and the analytic ability there exists a
difference far greater, indeed, than that between the fancy and the
imagination, but of a character very strictly analogous.  It will be
found, in fact, that the ingenious are always fanciful, and the <hi rend="italics">truly</hi>
imaginative never otherwise than analytic.</p>
          <p>The narrative which follows will appear to the reader somewhat
in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced.</p>
          <p>Residing in Paris during the spring and part of the summer of 18--,
I there became acquainted with a Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin.  This
young gentleman was of an excellent—indeed of an illustrious
family, but, by a variety of untoward events, had been reduced to
such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it,
and he ceased to bestir himself in the world, or to care for the
retrieval of his fortunes.  By courtesy of his creditors, there still
remained in his possession a small remnant of his patrimony; and,
upon the income arising from this, he managed, by means of a
rigorous economy, to procure the necessaries of life, without
troubling himself about its superfluities.  Books, indeed, were his
sole luxuries, and in Paris these are easily obtained.</p>
          <p>Our first meeting was at an obscure library in the Rue Montmartre,
where the accident of our both being in search of the same very
rare and very remarkable volume, brought us into closer communion.
We saw each other again and again.  I was deeply interested in the
little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor
which a Frenchman indulges whenever mere self is his theme.  I was
astonished, too, at the vast extent of his reading; and, above all,
I felt my soul enkindled within me by the wild fervor, and the vivid
freshness of his imagination.  Seeking in Paris the objects I then
sought, I felt that the society
<pb id="poe120" n="120"/>
of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price; and this
feeling I frankly confided to him.  It was at length arranged that we
should live together during my stay in the city; and as my worldly
circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own, I was
permitted to be at the expense of renting, and furnishing in a style
which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper, a
time-eaten and grotesque mansion, long deserted through superstitions
into which we did not inquire, and tottering to its fall in a
retired and desolate portion of the Faubourg St. Germain.</p>
          <p>Had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world,
we should have been regarded as madmen—although, perhaps, as
madmen of a harmless nature.  Our seclusion was perfect.  We
admitted no visitors.  Indeed the locality of our retirement had been
carefully kept a secret from my own former associates; and it had
been many years since Dupin had ceased to know or be known in
Paris.  We existed within ourselves alone.</p>
          <p>It was a freak of fancy in my friend (for what else shall I call it?)
to be enamored of the Night for her own sake; and into this <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">bizarrerie</hi></foreign>,
as into all his others, I quietly fell; giving myself up to his
wild whims with a perfect <hi rend="italics">abandon</hi>.  The sable divinity would not
herself dwell with us always; but we could counterfeit her presence.
At the first dawn of the morning we closed all the messy shutters of
our old building; lighting a couple of tapers which, strongly
perfumed, threw out only the ghastliest and feeblest of rays.  By the
aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams—reading, writing, or
conversing, until warned by the clock of the advent of the true
Darkness.  Then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm,
continuing the topics of the day, or roaming far and wide until a late
hour, seeking, amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous
city, that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can
afford.</p>
          <p>At such times I could not help remarking and admiring (although
from his rich ideality I had been prepared to expect it) a peculiar
analytic ability in Dupin.  He seemed, too, to take an eager delight in
its exercise—if not exactly in its display—and did not hesitate to
confess the pleasure thus derived.  He boasted
<pb id="poe121" n="121"/>
to me, with a low chuckling laugh, that most men, in respect to
himself, wore windows in their bosoms, and was wont to follow up
such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate
knowledge of my own.  His manner at these moments was frigid and
abstract; his eyes were vacant in expression; while his voice,
usually a rich tenor, rose into a treble which would have sounded
petulantly but for the deliberateness and entire distinctness of
the enunciation.  Observing him in these moods, I often dwelt
meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and
amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin—the creative and
the resolvent.</p>
          <p>Let it not be supposed, from what I have just said, that I am
detailing any mystery, or penning any romance.  What I have
described in the Frenchman, was merely the result of an excited, or
perhaps of a diseased intelligence.  But of the character of his
remarks at the periods in question an example will best convey the
idea.</p>
          <p>We were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the
vicinity of the Palais Royal.  Being both, apparently, occupied with
thought, neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at
least.  All at once Dupin broke forth with these words:</p>
          <p>“He is a very little fellow, that's true, and would do better for
the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Théâtre des Variétés</hi></foreign>.”</p>
          <p>“There can be no doubt of that,” I replied unwittingly, and not at
first observing (so much had I been absorbed in reflection) the
extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my
meditations.  In an instant afterward I recollected myself, and my
astonishment was profound.</p>
          <p>“Dupin,” said I, gravely, “this is beyond my comprehension.  I
do not hesitate to say that I am amazed, and can scarcely credit my
senses.  How was it possible you should know I was thinking of —— ?”
Here I paused, to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew
of whom I thought.</p>
          <p>—— “of Chantilly,” said he, “why do you pause?  You were
remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure unfitted him for
tragedy.”</p>
          <p>This was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections.
Chantilly was a <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">quondam</hi></foreign> cobbler of the Rue St. Denis,
<pb id="poe122" n="122"/>
who, becoming stage-mad, had attempted the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">rôle</hi></foreign> of Xerxes, in
Crébillon's tragedy so called, and been notoriously Pasquinaded
for his pains.</p>
          <p>“Tell me, for Heaven's sake,” I exclaimed, “the method—if
method there is—by which you have been enabled to fathom my
soul in this matter.”  In fact I was even more startled than I would
have been willing to express.</p>
          <p>“It was the fruiterer,” replied my friend, “who brought you to
the conclusion that the mender of soles was not of sufficient height
for Xerxes <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">et id genus omne</hi></foreign>.”</p>
          <p>“The fruiterer!—you astonish me—I know no fruiterer
whomsoever.”</p>
          <p>“The man who ran up against you as we entered the street—it
may have been fifteen minutes ago.”</p>
          <p>I now remembered that, in fact, a fruiterer, carrying upon his head
a large basket of apples, had nearly thrown me down, by accident,
as we passed from the Rue C ---- into the thoroughfare where we
stood; but what this had to do with Chantilly I could not
possibly understand.</p>
          <p>There was not a particle of <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">charlâtanerie</hi></foreign> about Dupin.  “I will
explain,” he said, “and that you may comprehend all clearly, we
will first retrace the course of your meditations, from the moment in
which I spoke to you until that of the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">rencontre</hi></foreign> with the fruiterer
in question.  The larger links of the chain run thus—Chantilly,
Orion, Dr. Nichols, Epicurus, Stereotomy, the street stones, the
fruiterer.”</p>
          <p>There are few persons who have not, at some period of their
lives, amused themselves in retracing the steps by which particular
conclusions of their own minds have been attained.  The occupation 
is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is
astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and
incoherence between the starting-point and the goal.  What, then,
must have been my amazement when I heard the Frenchman speak
what he had just spoken, and when I could not help acknowledging
that he had spoken the truth.  He continued:</p>
          <p>“We had been talking of horses, if I remember aright, just
before leaving the Rue C —— .  This was the last subject we
discussed.  As we crossed into this street, a fruiterer, with a
<pb id="poe123" n="123"/>
large basket upon his head, brushing quickly past us, thrust you
upon a pile of paving stones collected at a spot where the
causeway is undergoing repair.  You stepped upon one of the loose
fragments, slipped, slightly strained your ankle, appeared vexed or
sulky, muttered a few words, turned to look at the pile, and then
proceeded in silence.  I was not particularly attentive to what you
did; but observation has become with me, of late, a species of
necessity.</p>
          <p>“You kept your eyes upon the ground—glancing, with  a petulant
expression, at the holes and ruts in the pavement, (so that I saw
you were still thinking of the stones,) until we reached the
little alley called Lamartine, which has been paved, by way of
experiment, with the overlapping and riveted blocks.  Here your
countenance brightened up, and, perceiving your lips move, I could
not doubt that you murmured the word ‘stereotomy,’ a term very
affectedly applied to this species of pavement.  I knew that you
could not say to yourself ‘stereotomy’ without being brought to
think of atomies, and thus of the theories of Epicurus; and
since, when we discussed this subject not very long ago, I
mentioned to you how singularly, yet with how little notice, the
vague guesses of that noble Greek had met with confirmation in the
late nebular cosmogony, I felt that you could not avoid casting
your eyes upward to the great <hi rend="italics">nebula</hi> in Orion, and I certainly 
expected that you would do so.  You did look up; and I was now
assured that I had correctly followed your steps.  But in that bitter
<hi rend="italics">tirade</hi> upon Chantilly, which appeared in yesterday's ‘<hi rend="italics">Musée</hi>,’ the
satirist, making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler s change of
name upon assuming the buskin, quoted a Latin line about which we
have often conversed.  I mean the line</p>
          <lg>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">Perdidit antiquum litera prima sonum</foreign>
            </l>
          </lg>
          <p>I had told you that this was in reference to Orion, formerly written 
Urion; and, from certain pungencies connected with this explanation, 
I was aware that you could not have forgotten it.  It was clear,
therefore, that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of
Orion and Chantilly.  That you did combine them I saw by the character
of the smile which passed over your lips.  You
<pb id="poe124" n="124"/>
thought of the poor cobbler's immolation.  So far, you had been
stooping in your gait; but now I saw you draw yourself up to your
full height.  I was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive
figure of Chantilly.  At this point I interrupted your meditations to
remark that as, in fact, be was a very little fellow —that
Chantilly—he would do better at the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Théâtre des Variétés</hi></foreign>.”</p>
          <p>Not long after this, we were looking over an evening edition of
the “Gazette des Tribunaux,” when the following, paragraphs
arrested our attention.</p>
          <p>“EXTRAORDINARY MURDERS.—This morning, about three o'clock, the
inhabitants of the Quartier St. Roch were aroused from sleep by a
succession of terrific shrieks, issuing, apparently, from the fourth
story of a house in the Rue Morgue, known to be in the sole occupancy
of one Madame L'Espanaye, and her daughter Mademoiselle Camille
L'Espanaye.  After some delay, occasioned by a fruitless attempt to
procure admission in the usual manner, the gateway was broken in with
a crowbar, and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by
two <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarmes</hi></foreign>.  By this time the cries had ceased; but, as the party
rushed up the first flight of stairs, two or more rough voices in
angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the
upper part of the house.  As the second landing was reached,
these sounds, also, had ceased and everything remained perfectly
quiet.  The party spread themselves and hurried from room to room.
Upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story, (the door
of which, being found locked, with the key inside, was forced open,)
a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less
with horror than with astonishment.</p>
          <p>“The apartment was in the wildest disorder—the furniture
broken and thrown about in all directions.  There was only one
bedstead; and from this the bed had been removed, and thrown
into the middle of the floor.  On a chair lay a razor, besmeared
with blood.  On the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses
of grey human hair, also dabbled in blood, and seeming to have
been pulled out by the roots.  Upon the floor were found four
Napoleons, an ear-ring of topaz, three large silver spoons, three
smaller of<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics"> métal d'Alger</hi></foreign>, and two bags, containing nearly four
<pb id="poe125" n="125"/>
thousand francs in gold.  The drawers of a <hi rend="italics">bureau</hi>, which stood in
one corner were open, and had been, apparently, rifled, although
many articles still remained in them.  A small iron safe was
discovered under the <hi rend="italics">bed</hi> (not under the bedstead).  It was
open, with the key still in the door.  It had no contents beyond
a few old letters, and other papers of little consequence.</p>
          <p>“Of Madame L'Espanaye no traces were here seen; but an unusual
quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place, a search was
made in the chimney, and (horrible to relate!) the; corpse of
the daughter, head downward, was dragged therefrom; it having been
thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance.
The body was quite warm.  Upon examining it, many excoriations were
perceived, no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had
been thrust up and disengaged.  Upon the face were many severe
scratches, and, upon the throat, dark bruises, and deep indentations
of finger nails, as if the deceased had been throttled to death.</p>
          <p>“After a thorough investigation of every portion of the house,
without farther discovery, the party made its way into a small paved
yard in the rear of the building, where lay the corpse of the old
lady, with her throat so entirely cut that, upon an attempt to raise
her, the head fell off.  The body, as well as the head, was
fearfully mutilated—the former so much so as scarcely to retain
any semblance of humanity.</p>
          <p>“To this horrible mystery there is not as yet, we believe, the
slightest clew.”</p>
          <p>The next day's paper had these additional particulars.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">The Tragedy in the Rue Morgue.</hi>  Many individuals have been
examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair.
[The word ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">affaire</hi></foreign>’ has not yet, in France, that levity of import
which it conveys with us,] “but nothing whatever has transpired to
throw light upon it.  We give below all the material testimony elicited.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Pauline Dubourg</hi>, laundress, deposes that she has known both the
deceased for three years, having washed for them during that period.
The old lady and her daughter seemed on good terms—very
affectionate towards each other.  They were excellent pay.  Could
not speak in regard to their mode or means of
<pb id="poe126" n="126"/>
living.  Believed that Madame L. told fortunes for a living.
Was reputed to have money put by.  Never met any persons in the
house when she called for the clothes or took them home.  Was sure
that they had no servant in employ.  There appeared to be no
furniture in any part of the building except in the fourth story.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Pierre Moreau</hi>, tobacconist, deposes that he has been in the
habit of selling small quantities of tobacco and snuff to Madame
L'Espanaye for nearly four years.  Was born in the neighborhood,
and has always resided there.  The deceased and her daughter had
occupied the house in which the corpses were found, for more than
six years.  It was formerly occupied by a jeweller, who under-let the
upper rooms to various persons.  The house was the property of
Madame L.  She became dissatisfied with the abuse of the premises
by her tenant, and moved into them herself, refusing to let any
portion.  The old lady was childish.  Witness had seen the daughter
some five or six times during the six years.  The two lived an
exceedingly retired life—were reputed to have money.  Had heard it
said among the neighbors that Madame L. told fortunes—did not believe
it.  Had never seen any person enter the door except the old lady and
her daughter, a porter once or twice, and a physician some eight or
ten times.</p>
          <p>“Many other persons, neighbors, gave evidence to the same
effect.  No one was spoken of as frequenting the house.  It was not
known whether there were any living connexions of Madame L. and
her daughter.  The shutters of the front windows were seldom
opened.  Those in the rear were always closed, with the exception of
the large back room, fourth story.  The house was a good
house—not very old.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Isidore Muset</hi>, <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarme</hi></foreign>, deposes that he was called to the
house about three o'clock in the morning, and found some twenty or
thirty persons at the gateway, endeavoring to gain admittance.
Forced it open, at length, with a bayonet—not with a crowbar.
Had but little difficulty in getting it open, on account of its being a
double or folding gate, and bolted neither at bottom not top.  The
shrieks were continued until the gate was forced—and then
suddenly ceased.  They seemed to be screams of some person
<pb id="poe127" n="127"/>
(or persons) in great agony—were loud and drawn out, not short and
quick.  Witness led the way up stairs.  Upon reaching the first landing,
heard two voices in loud and angry contention—the one a gruff voice,
the other much shriller—a very strange voice.  Could distinguish some
words of the former, which was that of a Frenchman.  Was positive
that it was not a woman's voice.  Could distinguish the words ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">sacré</hi></foreign>’
and ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">diable.</hi></foreign>’  The shrill voice was that of a foreigner.  Could not be
sure whether it was the voice of a man or of a woman.  Could not
make out what was said, but believed the language to be Spanish.
The state of the room and of the bodies was described by this
witness as we described them yesterday.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Henri Duval</hi>, a neighbor, and by trade a silver-smith, deposes
that he was one of the party who first entered the house.
Corroborates the testimony of Musèt in general.  As soon as they
forced an entrance, they reclosed the door, to keep out the crowd,
which collected very fast, notwithstanding the lateness of the hour.
The shrill voice, this witness thinks, was that of an Italian.  Was
certain it was not French.  Could not be sure that it was a man's
voice.  It might have been a woman's.  Was not acquainted with the
Italian language.  Could not distinguish the words, but was convinced
by the intonation that the speaker was an Italian.  Knew Madame L.
and her daughter.  Had conversed with both frequently.  Was sure that
the shrill voice was not that of either of the deceased.</p>
          <p>“ ——  <hi rend="italics">Odenheimer, restaurateur.</hi>  This witness volunteered his
testimony.  Not speaking French, was examined through an
interpreter.  Is a native of Amsterdam.  Was passing the house at the
time of the shrieks.  They lasted for several minutes—probably ten.
They were long and loud—very awful and distressing.  Was one of
those who entered the building.  Corroborated the previous evidence
in every respect but one.  Was sure that the shrill voice was that of a
man—of a Frenchman.  Could not distinguish the words uttered.
They were loud and quick—unequal—spoken apparently in fear as
well as in anger.  The voice was harsh—not so much shrill as harsh.
Could not call it a shrill voice.  The gruff voice said repeatedly
‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">sacré</hi></foreign>,’ ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">diable</hi></foreign>,’ and once ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">mon Dieu.</hi></foreign>’</p>

          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Jules Mignaud</hi>, banker, of the firm of Mignaud et Fils, Rue
Deloraine.  Is the elder Mignaud.  Madame L'Espanaye had some
property.  Had opened an account with his banking house in the
spring of the year—(eight years previously).  Made frequent
deposits in small sums.  Had checked for nothing until the third day
before her death, when she took out in person the sum of 4000
francs.  This sum was paid in gold, and a clerk went home with the
money.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Adolphe Le Bon</hi>, clerk to Mignaud et Fils, deposes that on the
day in question, about noon, he accompanied Madame L'Espanaye
to her residence with the 4000 francs, put up in two bags.  Upon the
door being opened, Mademoiselle L. appeared and took from his
hands one of the bags, while the old lady relieved him of the other.
He then bowed and departed.  Did not see any person in the street
at the time.  It is a bye-street—very lonely.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">William Bird</hi>, tailor deposes that he was one of the party who
entered the house.  Is an Englishman.  Has lived in Paris two years.
Was one of the first to ascend the stairs.  Heard the voices in
contention.  The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.  Could make
out several words, but cannot now remember all.  Heard distinctly
‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">sacré</hi></foreign>’ and ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">mon Dieu.</hi></foreign>’  There was a sound at the moment as if of
several persons struggling—a scraping and scuffling sound.  The
shrill voice was very loud—louder than the gruff one.  Is sure
that it was not the voice of an Englishman.  Appeared to be that
of a German.  Might have been a woman's voice.  Does not understand
German.</p>
          <p>“Four of the above-named witnesses, being recalled, deposed that
the door of the chamber in which was found the body of
Mademoiselle L. was locked on the inside when the party reached it.
Every thing was perfectly silent—no groans or noises of any kind.
Upon forcing the door no person was seen.  The windows, both of
the back and front room, were down and firmly fastened from
within.  A door between the two rooms was closed, but not locked.
The door leading from the front room into the passage was locked,
with the key on the inside.  A small room in the front of the house,
on the fourth story, at the head of the passage was open, the door
being ajar.  This room was crowded with old beds, boxes, and so forth.
These were carefully removed
<pb id="poe129" n="129"/>
and searched.  There was not an inch of any portion of the house
which was not carefully searched. Sweeps were sent up and down the
chimneys.  The house was a four story one, with garrets (<hi rend="italics">mansardes.</hi>)
A trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely—did not
appear to have been opened for years.  The time elapsing between
the hearing of the voices in contention and the breaking open of the
room door, was variously stated by the witnesses.  Some made it as
short as three minutes—some as long as five.  The door was opened
with difficulty.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Alfonzo Garcio</hi>, undertaker, deposes that he resides in the Rue
Morgue.  Is a native of Spain.  Was one of the party who entered
the house.  Did not proceed up stairs.  Is nervous, and was
apprehensive of the consequences of agitation.  Heard the voices in
contention.  The gruff voice was that of a Frenchman.  Could not
distinguish what was said.  The shrill voice was that of an
Englishman—is sure of this.  Does not understand the English
language, but judges by the intonation.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Alberto Montani</hi>, confectioner, deposes that he was among the
first to ascend the stairs.  Heard the voices in question.  The gruff
voice was that of a Frenchman.  Distinguished several words.  The
speaker appeared to be expostulating.  Could not make out the
words of the shrill voice.  Spoke quick and unevenly.  Thinks it the
voice of a Russian.  Corroborates the general testimony.  Is an Italian.
Never conversed with a native of Russia.</p>
          <p>“Several witnesses, recalled, here testified that the chimneys of
all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the
passage of a human being.  By ‘sweeps’ were meant cylindrical
sweeping brushes, such as are employed by those who clean
chimneys.  These brushes were passed up and down every flue in the
house.  There is no back passage by which any one could have
descended while the party proceeded up stairs.  The body of
Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney
that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united
their strength.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Paul Dumas</hi>, physician, deposes that he was called to view the
bodies about day-break.  They were both then lying on the sacking of
the bedstead in the chamber where Mademoiselle L.
<pb id="poe130" n="130"/>
was found.  The corpse of the young lady was much bruised and
excoriated.  The fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would
sufficiently account for these appearances.  The throat was greatly
chafed.  There were several deep scratches just below the chin,
together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the
impression of fingers. The face was fearfully discolored, and the
eye-balls protruded.  The tongue had been partially bitten through.
A large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach, produced,
apparently, by the pressure of a knee.  In the opinion of M. Dumas,
Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been throttled to death by some person or
persons unknown.  The corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated.  All
the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered.  The
left <hi rend="italics">tibia</hi> much splintered, as well as all the ribs of the left side.
Whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored.  It was not possible to
say how the injuries had been inflicted.  A heavy club of wood, or a
broad bar of iron—a chair—any large, heavy, and obtuse weapon
would have produced such results, if wielded by the hands of a very
powerful man.  No woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon.
The head of the deceased, when seen by witness, was entirely separated
from the body, and was also greatly shattered.  The throat had evidently
been cut with some very sharp instrument—probably with a razor.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Alexandre Etienne</hi>, surgeon, was called with M. Dumas to view the
bodies.  Corroborated the testimony, and the opinions of M. Dumas.</p>
          <p>“Nothing farther of importance was elicited, although several other
persons were examined.  A murder so mysterious, and so perplexing in
all its particulars, was never before committed in Paris—if indeed
a murder has been committed at all.  The police are entirely at fault
—an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature.  There is not,
however, the shadow of a clew apparent.”</p>
          <p>The evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement
still continued in the Quartier St. Roch—that the premises in
question had been carefully re-searched, and fresh examinations of
witnesses instituted, but all to no purpose.  A postscript, however,
mentioned that Adolphe Le Bon had been arrested
<pb id="poe131" n="131"/>
and imprisoned—although nothing appeared to criminate him,
beyond the facts already detailed.</p>
          <p>Dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair—at least so I judged from his manner, for he made no comments.  It
was only after the announcement that Le Bon had been imprisoned,
that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders.</p>
          <p>I could merely agree with all Paris in considering them an insoluble
mystery.  I saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the
murderer.</p>
          <p>“We must not judge of the means,” said Dupin, “by this shell of an
examination. The Parisian police, so much extolled for <hi rend="italics">acumen</hi>, are
cunning, but no more.  There is no method in their proceedings,
beyond the method of the moment.  They make a vast parade of measures;
but, not unfrequently, these are so ill adapted to the objects
proposed, as to put us in mind of Monsieur Jourdain's calling for
his <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">robe-de-chambre—pour mieux entendre la musique.</hi></foreign>  The results
attained by them are not unfrequently surprising, but, for the most
part, are brought about by simple diligence and activity.  When
these qualities are unavailing, their schemes fail. Vidocq, for
example, was a good guesser and a persevering man. But, without
educated thought, he erred continually by the very intensity of his
investigations.  He impaired his vision by holding the object too close.
He might see, perhaps, one or two points with unusual clearness, but
in so doing he, necessarily, lost sight of the matter as a whole. Thus
there is such a thing as being too profound. Truth is not always in
a well.  In fact, as regards the more important knowledge, I do
believe that she is invariably superficial.  The depth lies in the
valleys where we seek her, and not upon the mountain-tops where
she is found.  The modes and sources of this kind of error are well
typified in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies.  To look at a
star by glances—to view it in a side-long way, by turning toward
it the exterior portions of the <hi rend="italics">retina</hi> (more susceptible of feeble
impressions of light than the interior), is to behold the star
distinctly—is to have the best appreciation of its lustre—a
lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision
<hi rend="italics">fully</hi> upon it.  A greater number of rays actually fall upon the
eye in the latter case, but, in the former, there is the more refined
<pb id="poe132" n="132"/>
capacity for comprehension.  By undue profundity we perplex and
enfeeble thought; and it is possible to make even Venus herself vanish
from the firmanent by a scrutiny too sustained, too concentrated,
or too direct.</p>
          <p>“As for these murders, let us enter into some examinations for
ourselves, before we make up an opinion respecting them.  An
inquiry will afford us amusement,” [I thought this an odd term, so
applied, but said nothing] “and, besides, Le Bon once rendered me a
service for which I am not ungrateful.  We will go and see the
premises with our own eyes.  I know G----, the Prefect of Police, and
shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission.”</p>
          <p>The permission was obtained, and we proceeded at once to the
Rue Morgue.  This is one of those miserable thoroughfares which
intervene between the Rue Richelieu and the Rue St. Roch.  It was
late in the afternoon when we reached it; as this quarter is at a great
distance from that in which we resided. The house was readily
found; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed
shutters, with an objectless curiosity, from the opposite side of the
way.  It was an ordinary Parisian house, with a gateway, on one side
of which was a glazed watch-box, with a sliding panel in the window,
indicating a <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">loge de concierge.</hi></foreign>  Before going in we walked up the
street, turned down an alley, and then, again turning, passed in the
rear of the building—Dupin, meanwhile examining the whole
neighborhood, as well as the house, with a minuteness of attention
for which I could see no possible object.</p>
          <p>Retracing our steps, we came again to the front of the dwelling,
rang, and, having shown our credentials, were admitted by
the agents in charge.  We went up stairs—into the chamber
where the body of Mademoiselle L'Espanaye had been found,
and where both the deceased still lay.  The disorders of the room
had, as usual, been suffered to exist.  I saw nothing beyond what
had been stated in the “Gazette des Tribunaux.”  Dupin scrutinized
every thing—not excepting the bodies of the victims.  We
then went into the other rooms, and into the yard; a <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarme</hi></foreign>
accompanying us throughout.  The examination occupied us 
until dark, when we took our departure.  On our way home my
<pb id="poe133" n="133"/>
companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily
papers.</p>
          <p>I have said that the whims of my friend were manifold, and that <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Je
les ménagais</hi></foreign>:—for this phrase there is no English equivalent.  It
was his humor, now, to decline all conversation on the subject of
the murder, until about noon the next day.  He then asked me,
suddenly, if I had observed any thing <hi rend="italics">peculiar</hi> at the scene of the
atrocity.</p>
          <p>There was something in his manner of emphasizing the word
“peculiar,” which caused me to shudder, without knowing why.</p>
          <p>“No, nothing <hi rend="italics">peculiar</hi>,” I said; “nothing more, at least, than we
both saw stated in the paper.”</p>
          <p>“The ‘Gazette,’ ” he replied, “has not entered, I fear, into the
unusual horror of the thing.  But dismiss the idle opinions of this
print.  It appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble, for
the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution—I mean for the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">outré</hi></foreign> character of its features.  The police are
confounded by the seeming absence of motive—not for the murder
itself—but for the atrocity of the murder.  They are puzzled, too,
by the seeming impossibility of reconciling the voices heard in
contention, with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but
the assassinated Mademoiselle L'Espanaye, and that there were no
means of egress without the notice of the party ascending. The wild
disorder of the room; the corpse thrust, with the head downward, up
the chimney; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old lady;
these considerations, with those just mentioned, and others which I
need not mention, have sufficed to paralyze the powers, by putting
completely at fault the boasted <hi rend="italics">acumen</hi>, of the government agents.
They have fallen into the gross but common error of confounding the
unusual with the abstruse.  But it is by these deviations from the
plane of the ordinary, that reason feels its way, if at all, in its search
for the true.  In investigations such as we are now pursuing, it should
not be so much asked ‘what has occurred,’ as ‘what has occurred that
has never occurred before.’  In fact, the facility with which I shall
arrive, or have arrived, at the solution of this mystery, is in the
direct ratio of its apparent insolubility in the eyes of the police.”</p>
          <pb id="poe134" n="134"/>
          <p>I stared at the speaker in mute astonishment.</p>
          <p>“I am now awaiting,” continued he, looking toward the door of
our apartment—“I am now awaiting a person who, although
perhaps not the perpetrator of these butcheries, must have been in
some measure implicated in their perpetration.  Of the worst portion
of the crimes committed, it is probable that he is innocent.  I hope
that I am right in this supposition; for upon it I build my expectation
of reading the entire riddle.  I look for the man here—in this
room—every moment.  It is true that he may not arrive; but the
probability is that he will.  Should he come, it will be necessary to
detain him.  Here are pistols; and we both know how to use them
when occasion demands their use.”</p>
          <p>I took the pistols, scarcely knowing what I did, or believing what
I heard, while Dupin went on, very much as if in a soliloquy.  I
have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times.  His
discourse was addressed to myself; but his voice, although by no
means loud, had that intonation which is commonly employed in
speaking to some one at a great distance.  His eyes, vacant in
expression, regarded only the wall.</p>
          <p>“That the voices heard in contention,” he said, “by the party
upon the stairs, were not the voices of the women themselves, was
fully proved by the evidence.  This relieves us of all doubt upon the
question whether the old lady could have first destroyed the
daughter and afterward have committed suicide.  I speak of this point
chiefly for the sake of method; for the strength of Madame
L'Espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting
her daughter's corpse up the chimney as it was found; and the nature
of the wounds upon her own person entirely preclude the idea of
self-destruction.  Murder, then, has been committed by some third
party; and the voices of this third party were those heard in
contention.  Let me now advert—not to the whole testimony
respecting these voices—but to what was <hi rend="italics">peculiar</hi> in that testimony.
Did you observe any thing peculiar about it?”</p>
          <p>I remarked that, while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the
gruff voice to be that of a Frenchman, there was much disagreement
in regard to the shrill, or, as one individual termed it, the
harsh voice.</p>
          <pb id="poe135" n="135"/>
          <p>“That was the evidence itself,” said Dupin, “but it was not the
peculiarity of the evidence.  You have observed nothing distinctive.
Yet there <hi rend="italics">was</hi> something to be observed.  The witnesses, as you
remark, agreed about the gruff voice; they were here unanimous.  But
in regard to the shrill voice, the peculiarity is—not that they
disagreed—but that, while an Italian, an Englishman, a Spaniard, a
Hollander, and a Frenchman attempted to describe it, each one
spoke of it as that <hi rend="italics">of a foreigner</hi>.  Each is sure that it was not the
voice of one of his own countrymen.  Each likens it—not to the
voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is
conversant—but the converse.  The Frenchman supposes it the voice
of a Spaniard, and ‘might have distinguished some words <hi rend="italics">had he
been acquainted with the Spanish.</hi>’  The Dutchman maintains it to
have been that of a Frenchman; but we find it stated that ‘<hi rend="italics">not
understanding French this witness was examined through an
interpreter.</hi>’  The Englishman thinks it the voice of a German, and
‘<hi rend="italics">does not understand German.</hi>’
The Spaniard ‘is sure’ that it was
that of an Englishman, but ‘judges by the intonation’ altogether, ‘<hi rend="italics">as he has no knowledge of the English.</hi>’
The Italian believes it the voice
of a Russian, but ‘<hi rend="italics">has never conversed with a native of Russia.</hi>’  A
second Frenchman differs, moreover, with the first, and is positive
that the voice was that of an Italian; but, <hi rend="italics">not being cognizant of that
tongue</hi>, is, like the Spaniard, ‘convinced by the intonation.’  Now,
how strangely unusual must that voice have really been, about which
such testimony as this <hi rend="italics">could</hi> have been elicited!—in whose <hi rend="italics">tones</hi>, even, denizens of the five great divisions of Europe could recognise
nothing familiar!  You will say that it might have been the voice of
an Asiatic—of an African.  Neither Asiatics nor Africans abound in
Paris; but, without denying the inference, I will now merely call your
attention to three points.  The voice is termed by one witness ‘harsh
rather than shrill.’  It is represented by two others to have been ‘quick
and <hi rend="italics">unequal.</hi>’  No words—no sounds resembling words—were by any
witness mentioned as distinguishable.</p>
          <p>“I know not,” continued Dupin, “what impression I may have
made, so far, upon your own understanding; but I do not hesitate
to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of
<pb id="poe136" n="136"/>
the testimony—the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices
—are in themselves sufficient to engender a suspicion which should
give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery.
I said ‘legitimate deductions;’ but my meaning is not thus fully
expressed.  I designed to imply that the deductions are the <hi rend="italics">sole</hi>
proper ones, and that the suspicion arises <hi rend="italics">inevitably</hi> from them as the
single result.  What the suspicion is, however, I will not say just yet.
I merely wish you to bear in mind that, with myself, it was sufficiently
forcible to give a definite form—a certain tendency—to my
inquiries in the chamber.</p>
          <p>“Let us now transport ourselves, in fancy, to this chamber.  What
shall we first seek here?  The means of egress employed by the
murderers.  It is not too much to say that neither of us believe in
præternatural events.  Madame and Mademoiselle L'Espanaye were
not destroyed by spirits.  The doers of the deed were material, and
escaped materially.  Then how?  Fortunately, there is but one mode
of reasoning upon the point, and that mode <hi rend="italics">must</hi> lead us to a
definite decision.—Let us examine, each by each, the possible means
of egress. It is clear that the assassins were in the room where
Mademoiselle L'Espanaye was found, or at least in the room adjoining,
when the party ascended the stairs.  It is then only from these two
apartments that we have to seek issues.  The police have laid bare the
floors, the ceilings, and the masonry of the walls, in every direction.
No <hi rend="italics">secret</hi> issues could have escaped their vigilance.  But, not trusting
to <hi rend="italics">their</hi> eyes, I examined with my own.  There were, then, no secret
issues.  Both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were
securely locked, with the keys inside.  Let us turn to the chimneys.
These, although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the
hearths, will not admit, throughout their extent, the body of a large
cat.  The impossibility of egress, by means already stated, being thus
absolute, we are reduced to the windows.  Through those of the front
room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the
street.  The murderers <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have passed, then, through those of the
back room.  Now, brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner
as we are, it is not our part, as reasoners, to reject it on account
<pb id="poe137" n="137"/>
of apparent impossibilities.  It is only left for us to prove that
these apparent ‘impossibilities’ are, in reality, not such.</p>
          <p>“There are two windows in the chamber.  One of them is unobstructed
by furniture, and is wholly visible. The lower portion of the
other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead
which is thrust close up against it.  The former was found
securely fastened from within.  It resisted the utmost force of those
who endeavored to raise it.  A large gimlet-hole had been pierced in
its frame to the left, and a very stout nail was found fitted therein,
nearly to the head.  Upon examining the other window, a similar nail
was seen similarly fitted in it; and a vigorous attempt to raise this
sash, failed also.  The police were now entirely satisfied that egress
had not been in these directions.  And, <hi rend="italics">therefore</hi>, it was thought a
matter of supererogation to withdraw the nails and open the windows.</p>
          <p>“My own examination was somewhat more particular, and was so for
the reason I have just given—because here it was, I knew, that
all apparent impossibilities <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be proved to be not such in
reality.</p>
          <p>“I proceeded to think thus—<foreign lang="ita" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">à posteriori</hi></foreign>.  The murderers did escape
from one of these windows.  This being so, they could not have 
refastened the sashes from the inside, as they were found
fastened;—the consideration which put a stop, through its
obviousness, to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter.  Yet the
sashes <hi rend="italics">were</hi> fastened.  They <hi rend="italics">must</hi>, then, have the power of fastening
themselves.  There was no escape from this conclusion.  I stepped to
the unobstructed casement, withdrew the nail with some difficulty
and attempted to raise the sash.  It resisted all my efforts, as I had
anticipated.  A concealed spring must, I now know, exist; and this
corroboration of my idea convinced me that my premises at least,
were correct, however mysterious still appeared the circumstances
attending the nails.  A careful search soon brought to light the hidden
spring.  I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery, forbore to
upraise the sash.</p>
          <p>“I now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively.  A person
passing out through this window might have reclosed it, and the
spring would have caught—but the nail could not have been
replaced.  The conclusion was plain, and again narrowed in the
<pb id="poe138" n="138"/>
field of my investigations.  The assassins <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have escaped
through the other window.  Supposing, then, the springs upon
each sash to be the same, as was probable, there <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be found a
difference between the nails, or at least between the modes of their
fixture.  Getting upon the sacking of the bedstead, I looked over the
head-board minutely at the second casement.  Passing my hand
down behind the board, I readily discovered and pressed the spring,
which was, as I had supposed, identical in character with its
neighbor.  I now looked at the nail.  It was as stout as the other, and
apparently fitted in the same manner—driven in nearly up to the
head.</p>
          <p>“You will say that I was puzzled; but, if you think so, you must
have misunderstood the nature of the inductions.  To use a sporting
phrase, I had not been once ‘at fault.’  The scent had never for an
instant been lost.  There was no flaw in any link of the chain.  I had
traced the secret to its ultimate result,—and that result was <hi rend="italics">the nail.</hi>
It had, I say, in every respect, the appearance of its fellow in the
other window; but this fact was an absolute nullity (conclusive us it
might seem to be) when compared with the consideration that here, at
this point, terminated the clew.  ‘There <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be something wrong,’ I
said, ‘about the nail.’  I touched it; and the head, with about a quarter
of an inch of the shank, came off in my fingers.  The rest of the shank
was in the gimlet-hole where it had been broken off.  The fracture
was an old one (for its edges were incrusted with rust), and had
apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer, which had
partially imbedded, in the top of the bottom sash, the head portion
of the nail.  I now carefully replaced this head portion in the
indentation whence I had taken it, and the resemblance to a perfect
nail was complete—the fissure was invisible.  Pressing the spring, I
gently raised the sash for a few inches; the head went up with it,
remaining firm in its bed.  I closed the window, and the semblance of
the whole nail was again perfect.</p>
          <p>“The riddle, so far, was now unriddled.  The assassin had
escaped through the window which looked upon the bed.  Droping
of its own accord upon his exit (or perhaps purposely closed), it
had become fastened by the spring; and it was the retention of
<pb id="poe139" n="139"/>
this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the
nail,—farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary.</p>
          <p>“The next question is that of the mode of descent.  Upon this point
I had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building.
About five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a
lightning-rod. From this rod it would have been impossible for any
one to reach the window itself, to say nothing of entering it.  I
observed, however, that the shutters of the fourth story were of the
peculiar kind called by Parisian carpenters <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">ferrades</hi></foreign>—a kind rarely
employed at the present day, but frequently seen upon very old
mansions at Lyons and Bourdeaux.  They are in the form of an
ordinary door, (a single, not a folding door) except that the lower half
is latticed or worked in open trellis—thus affording an excellent hold
for the hands.  In the present instance these shutters are fully three
feet and a half broad.  When we saw them from the rear of the house,
they were both about half open—that is to say, they stood off at
right angles from the wall.  It is probable that the police, as well as
myself, examined the back of the tenement; but, if so, in looking at
these <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">ferrades</hi></foreign> in the line of their breadth (as they must have done),
they did not perceive this great breadth itself, or, at all events, failed
to take it into due consideration.  In fact, having once satisfied
themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter, they
would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination.  It was
clear to me, however, that the shutter belonging to the window at the
head of the bed, would, if swung fully back to the wall, reach to
within two feet of the lightning-rod.  It was also evident that, by
exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage, an entrance
into the window, from the rod, might have been thus effected.—By
reaching to the distance of two feet and a half (we now suppose the
shutter open to its whole extent) a robber might have taken a firm
grasp upon the trellis-work.  Letting go, then, his hold upon the rod,
placing his feet securely against the wall, and springing boldly from
it, he might have swung the shutter so as to close it, and, if we
imagine the window open at the time, might even have swung himself
into the room.</p>
          <p>“I wish you to bear especially in mind that I have spoken of a
<hi rend="italics">very</hi> unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so
<pb id="poe140" n="140"/>
hazardous and so difficult a feat.  It is my design to show you, first,
that the thing might possibly have been accomplished:—but, secondly
and <hi rend="italics">chiefly</hi>, I wish to impress upon your understanding the <hi rend="italics">very extraordinary</hi>—the almost præternatural character of that agility
which could have accomplished it.</p>
          <p>“You will say, no doubt, using the language of the law, that ‘to
make out my case,’ I should rather undervalue, than insist upon a
full estimation of the activity required in this matter.  This may be
the practice in law, but it is not the usage of reason.  My ultimate
object is only the truth.  My immediate purpose is to lead you to
place in juxta-position, that <hi rend="italics">very unusual</hi> activity of which I have
just spoken with that <hi rend="italics">very peculiar</hi> shrill (or harsh) and <hi rend="italics">unequal</hi>
voice, about whose nationality no two persons could be found to
agree, and in whose utterance no syllabification could be
detected.”</p>
          <p>At these words a vague and half-formed conception of the meaning
of Dupin flitted over my mind.  I seemed to be upon the verge
of comprehension without power to comprehend—men, at times,
find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able,
in the end, to remember.  My friend went on with his discourse.</p>
          <p>“You will see,” he said, “that I have shifted the question from
the mode of egress to that of ingress. It was my design to convey
the idea that both were effected in the same manner, at the same
point. Let us now revert to the interior of the room.  Let us survey
the appearances here.  The drawers of the bureau, it is said, had
been rifled, although many articles of apparel still remained within
them.  The conclusion here is absurd.  It is a mere guess—a very
silly one—and no more.  How are we to know that the articles found
in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained?
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired
life—saw no company—seldom went out—had little use for
numerous changes of habiliment.  Those found were at least of as
good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies.  If a thief
had taken any, why did he not take the best—why did he not take
all? In a word, why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to 
encumber himself with a bundle of linen?  The gold <hi rend="italics">was</hi> abandoned.
<pb id="poe141" n="141"/>
Nearly the whole sum mentioned by Monsieur Mignaud, the
banker, was discovered, in bags, upon the floor.  I wish you,
therefore, to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of
<hi rend="italics">motive</hi>, engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the
evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house.
Coincidences ten times as remarkable as this (the delivery of the
money, and murder committed within three days upon the party
receiving it), happen to all of us every hour of our lives, without
attracting even momentary notice.  Coincidences, in general, are great
stumbling-blocks in the way of that class of thinkers who have been
educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities—that
theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are
indebted for the most glorious of illustration.  In the present
instance, had the gold been gone, the fact of its delivery three days
before would have formed something more than a coincidence.  It
would have been corroborative of this idea of motive.  But, under
the real circumstances of the case, if we are to suppose gold the
motive of this outrage, we must also imagine the perpetrator so
vacillating an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive
together.</p>
          <p>“Keeping now steadily in mind the points to which I have drawn
your attention—that peculiar voice, that unusual agility, and
that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious
as this—let us glance at the butchery itself.  Here is a woman
strangled to death by manual strength, and thrust up a chimney,
head downward.  Ordinary assassins employ no such modes of
murder as this.  Least of all, do they thus dispose of the murdered.
In the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney, you will admit
that there was something <hi rend="italics">excessively outré</hi>—something altogether
irreconcilable with our common notions of human action, even when
we suppose the actors the most depraved of men.  Think, too, how
great must have been that strength which could have thrust the
body <hi rend="italics">up</hi> such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several
persons was found barely sufficient to drag it <hi rend="italics">down!</hi></p>
          <p>“Turn, now, to other indications of the employment of a vigor
most marvellous.  On the hearth were thick tresses—very thick
tresses—of grey human hair.  These had been torn out by the
<pb id="poe142" n="142"/>
roots.  You are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus
from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together.  You saw the
locks in question as well as myself.  Their roots (a hideous sight!)
were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp—sure token of
the prodigious power which had been exerted in uprooting perhaps
half a million of hairs at a time.  The throat of the old lady was not
merely cut, but the head absolutely severed from the body: the
instrument was a mere razor.  I wish you also to look at the <hi rend="italics">brutal</hi>
ferocity of these deeds.  Of the bruises upon the body of Madame
L'Espanaye I do not speak.  Monsieur Dumas, and his worthy
coadjutor Monsieur Etienne, have pronounced that they were inflicted
by some obtuse instrument; and so far these gentlemen are very
correct.  The obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in
the yard, upon which the victim had fallen from the window which
looked in upon the bed.  This idea, however simple it may now
seem, escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of
the shutters escaped them—because, by the affair of the nails, their
perceptions had been hermetically sealed against the possibility of the
windows having ever been opened at all.</p>
          <p>“If now, in addition to all these things, you have properly reflected
upon the odd disorder of the chamber, we have gone so far as
to combine the ideas of an agility astounding, a strength
superhuman, a ferocity brutal, a butchery without motive, a 
<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">grotesquerie</hi></foreign> in horror absolutely alien from humanity, and a voice
foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations, and devoid of all
distinct or intelligible syllabification. What result, then, has ensued?
What impression have I made upon your fancy?”</p>
          <p>I felt a creeping of the flesh as Dupin asked me the question.  “A
madman,” I said, “has done this deed—some raving maniac,
escaped from a neighboring <hi rend="italics">Maison de Santé.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“In some respects,” he replied, “your idea is not irrelevant.  But
the voices of madmen, even in their wildest paroxysms, are never
found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs.
Madmen are of some nation, and their language, however
incoherent in its words, has always the coherence of 
syllabification.  Besides, the hair of a madman is not such as I now
hold in my hand.  I disentangled this little tuft from the rigidly
<pb id="poe143" n="143"/>
clutched fingers of Madame L'Espanaye.  Tell me what you can make
of it.”</p>
          <p>“Dupin!” I said, completely unnerved; “this hair is most
unusual—this is no <hi rend="italics">human</hi> hair.”</p>
          <p>“I have not asserted that it is,” said he; “but, before we decide
this point, I wish you to glance at the little sketch I have here traced
upon this paper.  It is a <hi rend="italics">fac-simile</hi> drawing of what has been
described in one portion of the testimony as ‘dark bruises, and deep
indentations of finger nails,’ upon the throat of Mademoiselle
L'Espanaye, and in another, (by Messrs. Dumas and Etienne,) as a
‘series of livid spots, evidently the impression of fingers.’</p>
          <p>“You will perceive,” continued my friend, spreading out the
paper upon the table before us, “that this drawing gives the idea of a
firm and fixed hold.  There is no <hi rend="italics">slipping</hi> apparent.  Each finger has
retained—possibly until the death of the victim—the fearful grasp
by which it originally imbedded itself.  Attempt, now, to place all
your fingers, at the same time, in the respective impressions as you
see them.”</p>
          <p>I made the attempt in vain.</p>
          <p>“We are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial,” he said.
“The paper is spread out upon a plane surface; but the human
throat is cylindrical.  Here is a billet of wood, the circumference of
which is about that of the throat.  Wrap the drawing around it, and
try the experiment again.”</p>
          <p>I did so; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before.
“This,” I said, “is the mark of no human hand.”</p>
          <p>“Read now,” replied Dupin, “this passage from Cuvier.”</p>
          <p>It was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of
the large fulvous Ourang-Outang of the East Indian Islands.  The
gigantic stature, the prodigious strength and activity, the wild
ferocity, and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are
sufficiently well known to all.  I understood the full horrors of the
murder at once.</p>
          <p>“The description of the digits,” said I, as I made an end of
reading, “is in exact accordance with this drawing.  I see that no
animal but an Ourang-Outang, of the species here mentioned, could
have impressed the indentations as you have traced them.
<pb id="poe144" n="144"/>
This tuft of tawny hair, too, is identical in character with that of the
beast of Cuvier.  But I cannot possibly comprehend the particulars
of this frightful mystery.  Besides, there were <hi rend="italics">two</hi> voices heard in
contention, and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a
Frenchman.”</p>
          <p>“True; and you will remember an expression attributed almost
unanimously, by the evidence, to this voice,—the expression, ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">mon
Dieu!</hi></foreign>’  This, under the circumstances, has been justly characterized by one
of the witnesses (Montani, the confectioner,) as an expression of
remonstrance or expostulation.  Upon these two words, therefore, I
have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle.  A
Frenchman was cognizant of the murder.  It is possible—indeed it is
far more than probable—that he was innocent of all participation in
the bloody transactions which took place.  The Ourang-Outang may
have escaped from him.  He may have traced it to the chamber; but,
under the agitating circumstances which ensued, he could never have
re-captured it.  It is still at large. I will not pursue these guesses— for
I have no right to call them more—since the shades of reflection
upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be 
appreciable by my own intellect, and since I could not pretend to make
them intelligible to the understanding of another.  We will call them
guesses then, and speak of them as such.  If the Frenchman in
question is indeed, as I suppose, innocent of this atrocity, this
advertisement which I left last night, upon our return home, at the
office of ‘Le Monde,’ (a paper devoted to the shipping interest, and
much sought by sailors,) will bring him to our residence.”</p>
          <p>He handed me a paper, and I read thus:</p>
          <p>CAUGHT—<hi rend="italics">In the Bois de Boulogne, early in the morning of
the—inst.,</hi> (the morning of the murder,) <hi rend="italics">a very large, tawny
Ourang-Outang of the Bornese species.  The owner, (who is 
ascertained to be a sailor, belonging to a Maltese vessel,) may 
have the animal again, upon identifying it satisfactorily, and
paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping.  Call
at No. ---- , Rue ----, Faubourg St. Germain—<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics">au troisiême.</foreign></hi></p>
          <pb id="poe145" n="145"/>
          <p>“How was it possible,” I asked, “that you should know the man
to be a sailor, and belonging to a Maltese vessel?”</p>
          <p>“I do <hi rend="italics">not</hi> know it,” said Dupin.  “I am not <hi rend="italics">sure</hi> of it.  Here,
however, is a small piece of ribbon, which from its form, and from its
greasy appearance, has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of
those long <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">queues</hi></foreign> of which sailors are so fond.  Moreover, this knot
is one which few besides sailors can tie, and is peculiar to the
Maltese.  I picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod.  It
could not have belonged to either of the deceased.  Now if, after all, I
am wrong in my induction from this ribbon, that the Frenchman was
a sailor belonging to a Maltese vessel, still I can have done no harm in
saying what I did in the advertisement.  If I am in error, he will merely
suppose that I have been misled by some circumstance into which he
will not take the trouble to inquire.  But if I am right, a great point is
gained.  Cognizant although innocent of the murder, the Frenchman
will naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement—about
demanding the Ourang-Outang.  He will reason thus:—‘I am innocent;
I am poor; my Ourang-Outang is of great value—to one in my
circumstances a fortune of itself—why should I lose it through idle
apprehensions of danger?  Here it is, within my grasp.  It was found in
the Bois de Boulogne—at a vast distance from the scene of that
butchery.  How can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should
have done the deed?  The police are at fault—they have failed to
procure the slightest clew.  Should they even trace the animal, it
would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder, or to
implicate me in guilt on account of that cognizance.  Above all, <hi rend="italics">I am
known.</hi>  The advertiser designates me as the possessor of the beast.  I
am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend.  Should I avoid
claiming a property of so great value, which it is known that I
possess, I will render the animal at least, liable to suspicion.  It is not
my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast.  I will
answer the advertisement, get the Ourang-Outang, and keep it close
until this matter has blown over.’ ”</p>
          <p>At this moment we heard a step upon the stairs.</p>
          <p>“Be ready,” said Dupin, “with your pistols, but neither use
them nor show them until at a signal from myself.”</p>
          <pb id="poe146" n="146"/>
          <p>The front door of the house had been left open, and the visiter
had entered, without ringing, and advanced several steps upon the
staircase.  Now, however, he seemed to hesitate.  Presently we heard
him descending.  Dupin was moving quickly to the door, when we
again heard him coming up.  He did not turn back a second time, but
stepped up with decision, and rapped at the door of our chamber.</p>
          <p>“Come in,” said Dupin, in a cheerful and hearty tone.</p>
          <p>A man entered.  He was a sailor, evidently,—a tall, stout, and
muscular-looking person, with a certain dare-devil expression of
countenance, not altogether unprepossessing.  His face, greatly
sunburnt, was more than half hidden by whisker and <hi rend="italics">mustachio.</hi>  He
had with him a huge oaken cudgel, but appeared to be otherwise
unarmed.  He bowed awkwardly, and bade us “good evening,” in
French accents, which, although somewhat Neufchatelish, were still
sufficiently indicative of a Parisian origin.</p>
          <p>“Sit down, my <sic>freind</sic>,” said Dupin.  “I suppose you have called
about the Ourang-Outang.  Upon my word, I almost envy you the
possession of him; a remarkably fine, and no doubt a very valuable
animal.  How old do you suppose him to be?”</p>
          <p>The sailor drew a long breath, with the air of a man relieved of
some intolerable burden, and then replied, in an assured tone:</p>
          <p>“I have no way of telling—but he can't be more than four or five
years old.  Have you got him here?”</p>
          <p>“Oh no, we had no conveniences for keeping him here.  He is
at a livery stable in the Rue Dubourg, just by.  You can get him in
the morning.  Of course you are prepared to identify the property?”</p>
          <p>“To be sure I am, sir.”</p>
          <p>“I shall be sorry to part with him,” said Dupin.</p>
          <p>“I don't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing,
sir,” said the man.  “Couldn't expect it.  Am very willing to
pay a reward for the finding of the animal—that is to say, any
thing in reason.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” replied my friend, “that is all very fair, to be sure.
Let me think!—what should I have?  Oh!  I will tell you.  My
reward shall be this.  You shall give me all the information in
your power about these murders in the Rue Morgue.”</p>
          <pb id="poe147" n="147"/>
          <p>Dupin said the last words in a very low tone, and very quietly.
Just as quietly, too, he walked toward the door, locked it and put the
key in his pocket.  He then drew a pistol from his bosom and placed it,
without the least flurry, upon the table.</p>
          <p>The sailor's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation.
He started to his feet and grasped his cudgel, but the next moment he
fell back into his seat, trembling violently, and with the countenance
of death itself.  He spoke not a word.  I pitied him from the bottom of
my heart.</p>
          <p>“My friend,” said Dupin, in a kind tone, “you are alarming
yourself unnecessarily—you are indeed.  We mean you no harm
whatever.  I pledge you the honor of a gentleman, and of a Frenchman,
that we intend you no injury.  I perfectly well know that you
are innocent of the atrocities in the Rue Morgue.  It will not do,
however, to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them.
From what I have already said, you must know that I have had means of
information about this matter—means of which you could never have
dreamed. Now the thing stands thus.  You have done nothing which you
could have avoided—nothing, certainly, which renders you culpable.
You were not even guilty of robbery, when you might have robbed with
impunity.  You have nothing to conceal.  You have no reason for
concealment.  On the other hand, you are bound by every principle
of honor to confess all you know.  An innocent man is now
imprisoned, charged with that crime of which you can point out the
perpetrator.”</p>
          <p>The sailor had recovered his presence of mind, in a great measure,
while Dupin uttered these words; but his original boldness of
bearing was all gone.</p>
          <p>“So help me God,” said he, after a brief pause, “I will tell you all
I know about this affair;—but I do not expect you to believe one
half I say—I would be a fool indeed if I did.  Still, I am innocent,
and I will make a clean breast if I die for it.”</p>
          <p>What he stated was, in substance, this.  He had lately made a
voyage to the Indian Archipelago.  A party, of which he formed
one, landed at Borneo, and passed into the interior on an excursion
of pleasure.  Himself and a companion had captured the Ourang-
Outang.  This companion dying, the animal fell into his
<pb id="poe148" n="148"/>
own exclusive possession.  After great trouble, occasioned by the
intractable ferocity of his captive during the home voyage, he at
length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in Paris,
where, not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his
neighbors, he kept it carefully secluded, until such time as it
should recover from a wound in the foot, received from a splinter
on board ship.  His ultimate design was to sell it.</p>
          <p>Returning home from some sailors' frolic the night, or rather in the
morning of the murder, he found the beast occupying his own bed-room,
into which it had broken from a closet adjoining, where it had
been, as was thought, securely confined.  Razor in hand, and fully
lathered, it was sitting before a looking-glass, attempting the
operation of shaving, in which it had no doubt previously watched
its master through the key-hole of the closet.  Terrified at the sight
of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious,
and so well able to use it, the man, for some moments, was at a
loss what to do.  He had been accustomed, however, to quiet the
creature, even in its fiercest moods, by the use of a whip, and to
this he now resorted.  Upon sight of it, the Ourang-Outang sprang at
once through the door of the chamber, down the stairs, and
thence, through a window, unfortunately open, into the street.</p>
          <p>The Frenchman followed in despair; the ape, razor still in hand,
occasionally stopping to look back and gesticulate at its pursuer,
until the latter had nearly come up with it.  It then again made off.
In this manner the chase continued for a long time.  The streets were
profoundly quiet, as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning.  In
passing down an alley in the rear of the Rue Morgue, the fugitive's
attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window
of Madame L'Espanaye's chamber, in the fourth story of her house.
Rushing to the building, it perceived the lightning rod, clambered
up with inconceivable agility, grasped the shutter, which was
thrown fully back against the wall, and, by its means, swung itself
directly upon the headboard of the bed.  The whole feat did not
occupy a minute.  The shutter was kicked open again by the
Ourang-Outang as it entered the room.</p>
          <p>The sailor, in the meantime, was both rejoiced and perplexed.  He
had strong hopes of now recapturing the brute, as it could
<pb id="poe149" n="149"/>
scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured, except
by the rod, where it might be intercepted as it came down.  On the
other hand, there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do
in the house.  This latter reflection urged the man still to follow
the fugitive.  A lightning rod is ascended without difficulty,
especially by a sailor; but, when he had arrived as high as the
window, which lay far to his left, his career was stopped; the
most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a
glimpse of the interior of the room.  At this glimpse he nearly fell
from his hold through excess of horror.  Now it was that those
hideous shrieks arose upon the night, which had startled from
slumber the inmates of the Rue Morgue.  Madame L'Espanaye and
her daughter, habited in their night clothes, had apparently been
occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already
mentioned, which had been wheeled into the middle of the room.  It
was open, and its contents lay beside it on the floor.  The victims
must have been sitting with their backs toward the window; and,
from the time elapsing between the ingress of the beast and the
screams, it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived.
The flapping-to of the shutter would naturally have been attributed
to the wind.</p>
          <p>As the sailor looked in, the gigantic animal had seized Madame
L'Espanaye by the hair, (which was loose, as she had been combing
it,) and was flourishing the razor about her face, in imitation of the
motions of a barber. The daughter lay prostrate and motionless; she
had swooned. The screams and struggles of the old lady (during
which the hair was torn from her head) had the effect of changing
the probably pacific purposes of the Ourang-Outang into those of
wrath.  With one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly
severed her head from her body.  The sight of blood inflamed its
anger into phrenzy.  Gnashing its teeth, and flashing fire from its
eyes, it flew upon the body of the girl, and imbedded its fearful
talons in her throat, retaining its grasp until she expired.  Its
wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the
bed, over which the face of its master, rigid with horror, was just
discernible.  The fury of the beast, who no doubt bore still in mind
the dreaded whip, was instantly converted into fear.  Conscious of
having deserved
<pb id="poe150" n="150"/>
punishment, it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds, and
skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation;
throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved, and dragging
the bed from the bedstead.  In conclusion, it seized first the corpse
of the daughter, and thrust it up the chimney, as it was found; then
that of the old lady, which it immediately hurled through the
window headlong.</p>
          <p>As the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden,
the sailor shrank aghast to the rod, and, rather gliding than
clambering down it, hurried at once home—dreading the
consequences of the butchery, and gladly abandoning, in his terror,
all solicitude about the fate of the Ourang-Outang.  The words heard
by the party upon the staircase were the Frenchman's exclamations of
horror and affright, commingled with the fiendish jabberings of the
brute.</p>
          <p>I have scarcely anything to add.  The Ourang-Outang must have
escaped from the chamber, by the rod, just before the break of the
door.  It must have closed the window as it passed through it.  It was
subsequently caught by the owner himself, who obtained for it a
very large sum at the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Jardin des Plantes.</hi></foreign>  Le Don was instantly
released, upon our narration of the circumstances (with some
comments from Dupin) at the bureau of the Prefect of Police.  This
functionary, however well disposed to my friend, could not
altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken,
and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two, about the propriety of
every person minding his own business.</p>
          <p>“Let him talk,” said Dupin,, who had not thought it necessary to
reply.  “Let him discourse; it will ease his conscience, I am satisfied
with having defeated him in his own castle.  Nevertheless, that he
failed in the solution of this mystery, is by no means that matter for
wonder which he supposes it; for, in truth, our friend the Prefect is
somewhat too cunning to be profound.  In his wisdom is no <hi rend="italics">stamen.</hi>
It is all head and no body, like the pictures of the Goddess Laverna,
—or, at best, all head and shoulders, like a codfish.  But he is a good
creature after all.  I like him especially for one master stroke of cant,
by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity.  I mean the
way he has ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">de nier ce qui est, et d'expliquer ce qui n'est pas.</hi></foreign>’ ”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" target="note6">*</ref></p>

          <p>THERE are few persons, even among the calmest thinkers, who
have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling
half-credence in the supernatural, by <hi rend="italics">coincidences</hi> of so seemingly
marvellous a character that, as <hi rend="italics">mere</hi> coincidences, the intellect has
been unable to receive them.  Such sentiments—for the half-
credences
<note id="note7" n="7" place="foor" anchored="yes" target="ref7">*Upon the original publication of “Marie Rogêt,” the foot-notes now
appended were considered unnecessary; but the lapse of several years
since the tragedy upon which the tale is based, renders it expedient
to give them, and also to say a few words in explanation of the general
design.  A young girl, <hi rend="italics">Mary Cecilia Rogers</hi>, was murdered in the
vicinity of New York; and, although her death occasioned an
intense and long-enduring excitement, the mystery attending it had
remained unsolved at the period when the present paper was written and
published (November, 1842).  Herein, under pretence of relating the fate
of a Parisian <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">grisette</hi></foreign>, the author has followed in minute detail, the
essential, while merely paralleling the inessential facts of the real
murder of Mary Rogers.  Thus all argument founded upon the fiction is
applicable to the truth: and the investigation of the truth was the object.
The “Mystery of Marie Rogêt” was composed at a distance from the scene of
the atrocity, and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers
afforded.  Thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed
himself had he been upon the spot, and visited the localities.  It may not
be improper to record, nevertheless, that the confessions of <hi rend="italics">two</hi> persons,
(one of them the Madame Deluc of the narrative) made, at different
periods, long subsequent to the publication, confirmed, in full, not only
the general conclusion, but absolutely <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the chief hypothetical details by
which that conclusion was attained.</note>

<pb id="poe152" n="152"/>
credences of which I speak have never the full force of <hi rend="italics">thought</hi>—such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to
the doctrine of chance, or, as it is technically termed, the Calculus of
Probabilities.  Now this Calculus is, in its essence, purely mathematical;
and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science
applied to the shadow and spirituality of the most intangible in
speculation.</p>
          <p>The extraordinary details which I am now called upon to make
public, will be found to form, as regards sequence of time, the
primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible <hi rend="italics">coincidences</hi>, whose
secondary or concluding branch will be recognized by all readers in
the late murder of <emph>Mary Cecila Rogers</emph>, at New York.</p>
          <p>When, in an article entitled “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” I
endeavored, about a year ago, to depict some very remarkable 
features in the mental character of my friend, the Chevalier C.
Auguste Dupin, it did not occur to me that I should ever resume the
subject.  This depicting of character constituted my design; and this
design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances
brought to instance Dupin's idiosyncrasy.  I might have adduced
other examples, but I should have proven no more.  Late events,
however, in their surprising development, have startled me into
some farther details, which will carry with them the air of extorted
confession.  Hearing what I have lately heard, it would be indeed
strange should I remain silent in regard to what I both heard and saw
so long ago.</p>
          <p>Upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of
Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter, the Chevalier dismissed the
affair at once from his attention, and relapsed into his old habits of
moody reverie.  Prone, at all times, to abstraction, I readily fell in
with his humor; and, continuing to occupy our
<pb id="poe153" n="153"/>
chambers in the Faubourg Saint Germain, we gave the Future to the
winds, and slumbered tranquilly in the Present, weaving the dull
world around us into dreams.</p>
          <p>But these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted.  It may readily
be supposed that the part played by my friend, in the drama at the
Rue Morgue, had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the
Parisian police.  With its emissaries, the name of Dupin had grown
into a household word.  The simple character of those inductions by
which he had disentangled the mystery never having been explained
even to the Prefect, or to any other individual than myself, of course
it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than
miraculous, or that the Chevalier's analytical abilities acquired for
him the credit of intuition.  His frankness would have led him to
disabuse every inquirer of such prejudice; but his indolent humor
forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself
had long ceased.  It thus happened that he found himself the
cynosure of the policial eyes; and the cases were not few in which
attempt was made to engage his services at the Prefecture. One of
the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young
girl named Marie Rogêt.</p>
          <p>This event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the Rue
Morgue.  Marie, whose Christian and family name will at once arrest
attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate “cigar-
girl,” was the only daughter of the widow Estelle Rogêt.  The father
had died during the child's infancy, and from the period of his death,
until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms
the subject of our narrative, the mother and daughter had dwelt
together in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée;<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" target="note9">*</ref> Madame there keeping a
<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">pension</hi></foreign>, assisted by Marie.  Affairs went on thus until the latter had
attained her twenty-second year, when her great beauty attracted
the notice of a perfumer, who occupied one of the shops in the
basement of the Palais Royal, and whose custom lay chiefly among
the desperate adventurers infesting that neighborhood.  Monsieur
Le Blanc<ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" target="note10">†</ref> was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from
the attendance of the fair Marie in his perfumery; and his liberal
proposals were
<note id="note9" n="9" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9">*Nassau Street. </note>                                       
<note id="note10" n="10" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">†Anderson.</note>
<pb id="poe154" n="154"/>
accepted eagerly by the girl, although with somewhat more of
hesitation by Madame.</p>
          <p>The anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized, and his
rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the sprightly
<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">grisette.</hi></foreign>  She had been in his employ about a year, when her admirers
were thrown info confusion by her sudden disappearance from the
shop.  Monsieur Le Blanc was unable to account for her absence, and
Madame Rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror.  The public
papers immediately took up the theme, and the police were upon the
point of making serious investigations, when, one fine morning, after
the lapse of a week, Marie, in good health, but with a somewhat
saddened air, made her re-appearance at her usual counter in the
perfumery.  All inquiry, except that of a private character, was of
course immediately hushed.  Monsieur Le Blanc professed total
ignorance, as before.  Marie, with Madame, replied to all questions,
that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the
country.  Thus the affair died away, and was generally forgotten; for
the girl, ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of
curiosity, soon bade a final adieu to the perfumer, and sought the
shelter of her mother's residence in the Rue Pavée Saint Andrée.</p>
          <p>It was about five months after this return home, that her
friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second
time.  Three days elapsed, and nothing was heard of her.  On the
fourth her corpse was found floating in the Seine,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref11" n="11" target="note11">*</ref> near the shore
which is opposite the Quartier of the Rue Saint Andree, and at a
point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the
Barrière du Roule.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" target="note12">†</ref></p>
          <p>The atrocity of this murder, (for it was at once evident that
murder had been committed,) the youth and beauty of the victim,
and, above all, her previous notoriety, conspired to produce intense
excitement in the minds of the sensitive Parisians.  I can call to mind
no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect.
For several weeks, in the discussion of this one absorbing theme, even
the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten.  The Prefect
made unusual exertions; and
<note id="note11" n="11" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref11">* The Hudson.  </note>
<note id="note12" n="12" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref12">†Weehawken.</note>
<pb id="poe155" n="155"/>
the powers of the whole Parisian police were, of course, tasked to
the utmost extent.</p>
          <p>Upon the first discovery of the corpse, it was not supposed that
the murderer would be able to elude, for more than a very brief
period, the inquisition which was immediately set on foot.  It was
not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to
offer a reward; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand
francs.  In the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor, if
not always with judgment, and numerous individuals were examined
to no purpose; while, owing to the continual absence of all clue to
the mystery, the popular excitement greatly increased.  At the end of
the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally
proposed; and, at length, the second week having elapsed without
leading to any discoveries, and the prejudice which always exists
in Paris against the Police having given vent to itself in several
serious <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">émeutes</hi></foreign>, the Prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum
of twenty thousand francs “for the conviction of the assassin,” or,
if more than one should prove to have been implicated, “for the
conviction of any one of the assassins.”  In the proclamation
setting forth this reward, a full pardon was promised to any
accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow;
and to the whole was appended, wherever it appeared, the private
placard of a committee of citizens, offering ten thousand francs,
in addition to the amount proposed by the Prefecture.  The entire
reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs, which will
be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble
condition of the girl, and the great frequency, in large cities, of
such atrocities as the one described.</p>
          <p>No one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be
immediately brought to light.  But although, in one or two instances,
arrests were made which promised elucidation, yet nothing was
elicited which could implicate the parties suspected; and they were
discharged forthwith.  Strange as it may appear, the third week
from the discovery of the body had passed, and passed without
any light being thrown upon the subject, before even a rumor of the
events which had so agitated the public mind, reached the ears of
Dupin and myself.  Engaged in
<pb id="poe156" n="156"/>
researches which absorbed our whole attention, it had been nearly a
month since either of us had gone abroad, or received a visiter, or
more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily
papers.  The first intelligence of the murder was brought us by G ----,
in person.  He called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth
of July, 18--, and remained with us until late in the night.  He had
been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the
assassins.  His reputation—so he said with a peculiarly Parisian air
—was at stake.  Even his honor was concerned.  The eyes of the public
were upon him; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not
be willing to make for the development of the mystery.  He concluded a
somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased
to term the <hi rend="italics">tact</hi> of Dupin, and made him a direct, and certainly a
liberal proposition, the precise nature of which I do not feel myself
at liberty to disclose, but which has no bearing upon the proper subject
of my narrative.</p>
          <p>The compliment my friend rebutted as best he could, but the
proposition he accepted at once, although its advantages were
altogether provisional.  This point being settled, the Prefect broke
forth at once into explanations of his own views, interspersing
them with long comments upon the evidence; of which latter we
were not yet in possession.  He discoursed much, and beyond
doubt, learnedly; while I hazarded an occasional suggestion as the
night wore drowsily away.  Dupin, sitting steadily in his accustomed
arm-chair, was the embodiment of respectful attention.  He wore
spectacles, during the whole interview; and an occasional signal
glance beneath their green glasses, sufficed to convince me that he
slept not the less soundly, because silently, throughout the seven or
eight leaden-footed hours which immediately preceded the departure
of the Prefect.</p>
          <p>In the morning, I procured, at the Prefecture, a full report of all
the evidence elicited, and, at the various newspaper offices, a copy
of every paper in which, from first to last, had been published any
decisive information in regard to this sad affair.  Freed from all
that was positively disproved, this mass of information stood thus:</p>
          <p>Marie Rogêt left the residence of her mother, in the Rue
<pb id="poe157" n="157"/>
Pavée St. Andrée, about nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday June
the twenty-second, 18--.  In going out, she gave notice to a Monsieur
Jacques St. Eustache,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" target="note13">*</ref> and to him only, of her intent intention to
spend the day with an aunt who resided in the Rue des Drômes.  The
Rue des Drômes is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare,
not far from the banks of the river, and at a distance of some two
miles, in the most direct course possible, from the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">pension</hi></foreign> of
Madame Rogêt.  St.  Eustache was the accepted suitor of Marie, and
lodged, as well as took his meals, at the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">pension.</hi></foreign>  He was to have
gone for his betrothed at dusk, and to have escorted her home.  In the
afternoon, however, it came on to rain heavily; and, supposing that
she would remain all night at her aunt's, (as she had done under
similar circumstances before,) he did not think it necessary to keep
his promise.  As night drew on, Madame Rogêt (who was an infirm
old lady, seventy years of age,) was heard to express a fear “that she
should never see Marie again;” but this observation attracted little
attention at the time.</p>
          <p>On Monday, it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the
Rue des Drômes; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her, a
tardy search was instituted at several points in the city, and its
environs.  It was not, however until the fourth day from the period of
disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting
her.  On this day, (Wednesday, the twenty-fifth of June,) a
Monsieur Beauvais, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" target="note14">†</ref> who, with a friend, had been making
inquiries for Marie near the Barrière du Roule, on the shore of the
Seine which is opposite the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, was informed that
a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen, who had
found it floating in the river.  Upon seeing the body, Beauvais, after
some hesitation, identified it as that of the perfumery-girl.  His
friend recognized it more promptly.</p>
          <p>The face was suffused with dark blood, some of which issued
from the mouth.  No foam was seen, as in the case of the merely
drowned.  There was no discoloration in the cellular tissue.  About
the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers.  The arms were
bent over on the chest and were rigid.  The right
<note id="note13" n="13" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref13">*Payne.  </note>
<note id="note14" n="14" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14">†Crommelin.</note>
<pb id="poe158" n="158"/>
hand was clenched; the left partially open.  On the left wrist were
two circular excoriations, apparently the effect of ropes, or of a rope
in more than one volution.  A part of the right wrist, also, was much
chafed, as well as the back throughout its extent, but more especially
at the shoulder-blades.  In bringing the body to the shore the
fishermen had attached to it a rope; but none of the excoriations had
been effected by this.  The flesh of the neck was much swollen.
There were no cuts apparent, or bruises which appeared the effect of
blows.  A piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as
to be hidden from sight; it was completely buried in the flesh, and
was fasted by a knot which lay just under the left ear.  This alone
would have sufficed to produce death.  The medical testimony spoke
confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased.  She had been
subjected, it said, to brutal  violence.  The corpse was in such
condition when found, that there could have been no difficulty in
its recognition by friends.</p>
          <p>The dress was much torn and otherwise disordered.  In the outer
garment, a slip, about a foot wide, had been torn upward from the bottom
hem to the waist, but not torn off.  It was wound three times around the
waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.  The dress
immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin; and from this a
slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out—torn very
evenly and with great care.  It was found around her neck, fitting
loosely, and secured with a hard knot.  Over this muslin slip and the
slip of lace, the strings of a bonnet were attached; the bonnet being
appended.  The knot by which the strings of the bonnet were
fastened, was not a lady's, but a slip or sailor's knot.</p>
          <p>After the recognition of the corpse, it was not, as usual, taken
to the Morgue, (this formality being superfluous,) but hastily
interred not far front the spot at which it was brought ashore.
Through the exertions of Beauvais, the matter was industriously
hushed up, as far as possible; and several days had elapsed before any
public emotion resulted.  A weekly paper,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref15" n="15" target="note15">*</ref> however, at length took
up the theme; the corpse was disinterred, and a
<note id="note15" n="15" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref15">*The “N. Y. Mercury.”</note>
<pb id="poe159" n="159"/>
re-examination instituted; but nothing was elicited beyond what has
been already noted.  The clothes, however, were now submitted to
the mother and friends of the deceased, and fully identified as those
worn by the girl upon leaving home.</p>
          <p>Meantime, the excitement increased hourly.  Several individuals were
arrested and discharged.  St.  Eustache fell especially under suspicion;
and he failed, at first, to give an intelligible account of his
whereabouts during the Sunday on which Marie left home.
Subsequently, however, he submitted to Monsieur G----, affidavits,
accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question.  As
time passed and no discovery ensued, a thousand contradictory
rumors were circulated, and journalists busied themselves in
<hi rend="italics">suggestions.</hi>  Among these, the one which attracted the most
notice, was the idea that Marie Rogêt still lived—that the corpse
found in the Seine was that of some other unfortunate.  It will be
proper that I submit to the reader some passages which embody
the suggestion alluded to.  These passages are <hi rend="italics">literal</hi> translations
from L'Etoile,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref16" n="16" target="note16">*</ref> a paper conducted, in general, with much ability.</p>
          <p>“Mademoiselle Rogêt left her mother's house on Sunday morning, June
the twenty-second, 18--, with the ostensible purpose of going to see her
aunt, or some other connexion, in the Rue des Drômes.  From that hour,
nobody is proved to have seen her.  There is no trace or tidings of her at
all.  * * * *  There has no person, whatever, come forward, so far, who
saw her at all, on that day, after she left her mother's door.  * * * *
Now, though we have no evidence that Marie Rogêt was in the land of
the living after nine o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second, we have
proof that, up to that hour, she was alive.  On Wednesday noon, at
twelve, a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the Barrière
de Roule.  This was, even if we presume that Marie Rogêt was thrown
into the river within three hours after she left her mother's house, only
three days from the time she left her home—three days to an hour.  But
it is folly to suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on her
body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her
murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.  Those who
are guilty of such horrid crimes, choose darkness rather the; light  * * * *
Thus we see that if the body found in the river <hi rend="italics">was</hi> that of Marie Rogêt, it
could only have been in the water two and a half days, or three at the
outside.  All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies
thrown into the water immediately after death by violence, require from
six to ten
<note id="note16" n="16" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16">*The “N. Y. Brother Jonathan,” edited by H. Hastings Weld, Esq.</note>
<pb id="poe160" n="160"/>
days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water.  Even where
a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it
sinks again, if let alone.  Now, we ask, what was there in this cave to cause a departure
from the ordinary course of nature?  * * * *  If the body had been kept in its mangled
state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on shore of the murderers.
It is a doubtful point, also, whether the body would be so soon afloat, even were it
thrown in after having been dead two days.  And, furthermore, it is exceedingly
improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here
supposed, would have throw the body in without weight to sink it, when such
a precaution could have so easily been taken.”</p>
          <p>The editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been
in the water “not three days merely, but, at least, five times three days,”
because it was so far decomposed that Beauvais had great difficulty in
recognizing it.  This latter point, however, was fully disproved.  I continue
the translation:</p>
          <p>“What, then, are the facts on which M. Beauvais says that he has no doubt the
body was that of Marie Rogêt?  He ripped up the gown sleeve, and says he found
marks which satisfied him of the identity.  The public generally supposed those marks
to have consisted of some description of scars.  He rubbed the arm and found <hi rend="italics">hair</hi>
upon it—something as indefinite, we think, as can readily be imagined—as little
conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve.  M. Beauvais did not return that night,
but sent word to Madame Rogêt, at seven o'clock, on Wednesday evening, that an
investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter.  If we allow that Madame
Rogêt, from her age and grief, could not go over, (which is allowing a great deal,)
there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to
go over and attend the investigation, if they thought the body was that of Marie.
Nobody went over.  There was nothing said or heard about the matter in the Rue
Pavée St. Andrée, that reached even the occupants of the same building.  M. St.
Eustache, the lover and intended husband of Marie, who boarded in her mother's
house, deposes that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended
until the next morning, when M. Beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it.
For an item of news like this, it strikes us it was very coolly received.”</p>
          <p>In this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of
an apathy on the part of the relatives of Marie, inconsistent with
the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers.
Its insinuations amount to this:—that Marie, with the connivance
of her friends, had absented herself from the city for reasons 
involving a charge against her chastity; and that these friends,
<pb id="poe161" n="161"/>
upon the discovery of a corpse in the Seine, somewhat resembling
that of the girl, had availed themselves of the opportunity to
impress press the public with the belief of her death.  But L'Etoile
was again over-hasty.  It was distinctly proved that no apathy, such
as was imagined, existed; that the old lady was exceedingly feeble, and
so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty, that St. Eustache,
so far from receiving the news coolly, was distracted with grief, and
bore himself so frantically, that M. Beauvais prevailed upon a
friend and relative to take charge of him, and prevent his attending
the examination at the disinterment.  Moreover, although it was stated
by L'Etoile, that the corpse was re-interred at the public expense—
that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely
declined by the family—and that no member of the family attended
the ceremonial:—although, I say, all this was asserted by L'Etoile in
furtherance of the impression it designed to convey—yet <hi rend="italics">all</hi> this was
satisfactorily disproved.  In a subsequent number of the paper, an
attempt was made to throw suspicion upon Beauvais himself.  The
editor says:</p>
          <p>“Now, then, a change comes over the matter.  We are told that on one
occasion, while a Madame B---- was at Madame Rogêt's house, M. Beauvais,
who was going out, told her that a <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarme</hi></foreign> was expected there, and
she, Madame B., must not say anything to the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarme</hi></foreign> until he
returned, but let the matter be for him.  * * * *  In the present posture of
affairs, M. Beauvais appears to have the whole matter looked up in his head.
A single step cannot be taken without M. Beauvais; for, go which way you will,
you run against him.  * * * * * For some reason, he determined that nobody
shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself, and he has elbowed
the male relatives out of the way, according to their representations, in a very
singular manner.  He seems to have been very much averse to permitting the
relatives to see the body.”</p>
          <p>By the following fact, some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon
Beauvais.  A visiter at his office, a few days prior to the girl's disappearance, and
during the absence of its occupant, had observed <hi rend="italics">a rose</hi> in the key-hole of the
door, and the name “<hi rend="italics">Marie</hi>” inscribed upon a slate which hung near at hand.</p>
          <p>The general impression, so far as we were enabled to glean it from the
newspapers, seemed to be, that Marie had been the victim
<pb id="poe162" n="162"/>
of <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi> of desperadoes—that by these she had been borne across
the river, maltreated and murdered.  Le Commerciel,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref17" n="17" target="note17">*</ref> however, a print
of extensive influence, was earnest in combating this popular idea.  I
quote a passage or two from its columns:</p>
          <p>“We are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent, so far
as it has been directed to the Barrière du Roule.  It is impossible that a
person so well known to thousands as this young woman was, should
have passed three blocks without some one having seen her; and any one
who saw her would have remembered it, for she interested all who knew
her.  It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out.  * *
*  It is impossible that she could have gone to the Barrière du Roule, or
to the Rue des Drômes, without being recognized by a dozen persons;
yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother's door,
and there is no evidence, except the testimony concerning her
<hi rend="italics">expressed intentions</hi>, that she did go out at all.  Her gown was torn, bound
round her, and tied; and by that the body was carried as a bundle.  If the
murder had been committed at the Barrière du Roule, there would have
been no necessity for any such arrangement.  The fact that the body was
found floating near the Barrière, is no proof as to where it was thrown
into the water.  * * * * *  A piece of one of the unfortunate girl's
petticoats, two feet long and one foot wide, was torn out and tied under
her chin around the back of her head, probably to prevent screams.
This was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief.”</p>
          <p>A day or two before the Prefect called upon us, however, some
important information reached the police, which seemed to overthrow,
at least, the chief portion of Le Commerciel's argument.  Two small
boys, sons of a Madame Deluc, while roaming among the woods
near the Barrière du Roule, chanced to penetrate a close thicket, within
which were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat, with a
back and footstool.  On the upper stone lay a white petticoat; on the
second a silk scarf.  A parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief were
also here found.  The handkerchief bore the name “Marie Rogêt.”
Fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around.  The earth
was trampled, the bushes were broken, and there was every evidence of
a struggle.  Between the thicket and the river, the fences were found
taken down, and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen
having been dragged along it.</p>
          <note id="note17" n="17" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref17">*N. Y. “Journal of Commerce.”</note>
          <pb id="poe163" n="163"/>
          <p>A weekly paper, Le Soleil,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" resp="note18">*</ref> had the following comments upon this
discovery—comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the
whole Parisian press:</p>
          <p>“The things had all evidently been there at least three or four
weeks; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain
and stuck together from mildew.  The grass had grown around and over
some of them.  The silk on the parasol was strong, but the threads of it
were run together within.  The upper part, where it had been doubled
and folded, was all mildewed and rotten, and tore on its being opened.
* * * *  The pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three
inches wide and six inches long.  One part was the hem of the frock,
and it had been mended; the other piece was part of the skirt, not the
hem.  They looked like strips torn off, and were on the thorn bush, about
a foot from the ground.  * * * * * There can be no doubt, therefore, that
the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered.”</p>
          <p>Consequent upon this discovery, new evidence appeared.  Madame
Deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of
the river, opposite the Barrière du Roule.  The neighborhood is
secluded—particularly so.  It is the usual Sunday resort of blackguards
from the city, who cross the river in boats.  About three o'clock, in the
afternoon of the Sunday in question, a young girl arrived at the inn,
accompanied by a young man of dark complexion.  The two remained
here for some time.  On their departure, they took the road to some
thick woods in the vicinity.  Madame Deluc's attention was called to the
dress worn by the girl, on account of its resemblance to one worn by a
deceased relative.  A scarf was particularly noticed.  Soon after the
departure of the couple, a gang of miscreants made their appearance,
behaved boisterously, ate and drank without making payment, followed
in the route of the young man and girl, returned to the inn about dusk,
and re-crossed the river as if in great haste.</p>
          <p>It was soon after dark, upon this same evening, that Madame
Deluc, as well as her eldest son, heard the screams of a female in
the vicinity of the inn.  The screams were violent but brief.  Madame
D. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket,
but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse.

<pb id="poe164" n="164"/>
An omnibus driver, Valence,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" target="note19">*</ref> now also testified that he saw Marie
Rogêt cross a ferry on the Seine, on the Sunday in question, in
company with a young man of dark complexion.  He, Valence, knew
Marie, and could not be mistaken in her identity.  The articles found
in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of Marie.</p>
          <p>The items of evidence and information thus collected by myself,
from the newspapers, at the suggestion of Dupin, embraced only one
more point—but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence.  It
appears that, immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above
described, the lifeless, or nearly lifeless body of St. Eustache,
Marie's betrothed, was found in the vicinity of what all now
supposed the scene of the outrage.  A phial labelled “laudanum,”
and emptied, was found near him.  His breath gave evidence of the
poison.  He died without speaking.  Upon his person was found a
letter, briefly stating his love for Marie, with his design of self-
destruction.</p>
          <p>“I need scarcely tell you,” said Dupin, as he finished the perusal
of my notes, “that this is a far more intricate case than that of the
Rue Morgue; from which it differs in one important respect.  This is
an <hi rend="italics">ordinary</hi>, although an atrocious instance of crime.  There is nothing
peculiarly <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">outré</hi></foreign> about it.  You will observe that, for this reason, the
mystery has been considered easy, when, for this reason, it should
have been considered difficult, of solution.  Thus; at first, it was
thought unnecessary to offer a reward.  The myrmidons of G--- were
able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity <hi rend="italics">might
have been</hi> committed.  They could picture to their imaginations a
mode—many modes—and a motive—many motives; and because it
was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives
<hi rend="italics">could</hi> have been the actual one, they have taken it for granted that
one of them <hi rend="italics">must.</hi>  But the case with which these variable fancies
were entertained, and the very plausibility which each assumed,
should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties
than of the facilities which must attend elucidation.  I have before
observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the
<note id="note19" n="19" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref19">*Adam</note>
<pb id="poe165" n="165"/>
ordinary, that reason feels her way, if at all, in her search for the true,
and that the proper question in cases such as this, is not so much
‘what has occurred?’ as ‘what has occurred that has never occurred
before?’  In the investigations at the house of Madame L'Espanaye,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" target="note20">*</ref>
the agents of G---- were discouraged and confounded by that very
<hi rend="italics">unusualness</hi> which, to a properly regulated intellect, would have
afforded the surest omen of success; while this same intellect might
have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met
the eye in the case of the perfumery-girl, and yet told of nothing but
easy triumph to the functionaries of the Prefecture.</p>
          <p>“In the case of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter there was,
even at the beginning of our investigation, no doubt that murder had
been committed.  The idea of suicide was excluded at once.  Here, too,
we are freed, at the commencement, from all supposition of self-
murder.  The body found at the Barrière du Roule, was found under
such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon
this important point.  But it has been suggested that the corpse
discovered, is not that of the Marie Rogêt for the conviction of
whose assassin, or assassins, the reward is offered, and respecting
whom, solely, our agreement has been arranged with the Prefect.  We
both know this gentleman well.  It will not do to trust him too far.  If,
dating our inquiries from the body found, and thence tracing a
murderer, we yet discover this body to be that of some other
individual than Marie; or, if starting from the living Marie, we find
her, yet find her unassassinated—in either case we lose our labor;
since it is Monsieur G---- with whom we have to deal.  For our
own purpose, therefore, if not for the purpose of justice, it is
indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the
identity of the corpse with the Marie Rogêt who is missing.</p>
          <p>“With the public the arguments of L'Etoile have had weight; and
that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear
from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the
subject—‘Several of the morning papers of the day,’ it says, ‘speak
of the <hi rend="italics">conclusive</hi> article in Monday's Etoile.’
<note id="note20" n="20" place="foot20" anchored="yes" target="ref20">*See “Murders in the Rue Morgue.”</note>
<pb id="poe166" n="166"/>
To me, this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its
inditer.  We should bear in mind that, in general, it is the object of our
newspapers rather to create a sensation—to make a point—than to
further the cause of truth.  The latter end is only pursued when it
seems coincident with the former.  The print which merely falls in
with ordinary opinion (however well founded this opinion may be)
earns for itself no credit with the mob.  The mass of the people
regard as profound only him who suggests <hi rend="italics">pungent contradictions</hi> of
the general idea.  In ratiocination, not less than in literature, it is the
<hi rend="italics">epigram</hi> which is the most immediately and the most universally
appreciated.  In both, it is of the lowest order of merit.</p>
          <p>“What I mean to say is, that it is the mingled epigram and
melodrame of the idea, that Marie Rogêt still lives, rather than any
true plausibility in this idea, which have suggested it to L'Etoile, and
secured it a favorable reception with the public.  Let us examine the
heads of this journal's argument; endeavoring to avoid the
incoherence with which it is originally set forth.</p>
          <p>“The first aim of the writer is to show, from the brevity of the
interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the floating
corpse, that this corpse cannot be that of Marie.  The reduction of
this interval to its smallest possible dimension, becomes thus, at
once, an object with the reasoner.  In the rash pursuit of this object,
he rushes into mere assumption at the outset.  ‘It is folly to
suppose,’ he says, ‘that the murder, if murder was committed on her
body, could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her
murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight.’  We
demand at once, and very naturally, <hi rend="italics">why</hi>?  Why is it folly to suppose
that the murder was committed <hi rend="italics">within five minutes</hi> after the girl's quitting
her mother's house?  Why is it folly to suppose that the murder was
committed at any given period of the day?  There have been 
assassinations at all hours.  But, had the murder taken place at any
moment between nine o'clock in the morning of Sunday, and a quarter
before midnight, there would still have been time enough ‘'to throw
the body into the river before midnight.’  This assumption, then,
amounts precisely to this—that the murder was not committed on
Sunday at all—and, if we allow L'Etoile to 
<pb id="poe167" n="167"/>
assume this, we may permit it any liberties whatever.  The
paragraph beginning ‘It is folly to suppose that the murder, etc.,’
however it appears as printed in L'Etoile, may be imagined to have
existed actually <hi rend="italics">thus</hi> in the brain of its inditer—‘It is folly to
suppose that the murder, if murder was committed on the body,
could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her
murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight; it is
folly, we say, to suppose all this, and to suppose at the same time,
(as we are resolved to suppose,) that the body was not thrown in
until <hi rend="italics">after</hi> midnight’—a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in
itself, but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed.</p>
          <p>“Were it my purpose,” continued Dupin, “merely to <hi rend="italics">make out a
case</hi> against this passage of L'Etoile's argument, I might safely leave
it where it is.  It is not, however, with L'Etoile that we have to do,
but with the truth.  The sentence in question has but one meaning, as
it stands; and this meaning I have fairly stated: but it is material that
we go behind the mere words, for an idea which these words have
obviously intended, and failed to convey.  It was the design of the
journalist to say that, at whatever period of the day or night of
Sunday this murder was committed, it was improbable that the
assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before
midnight.  And herein lies, really, the assumption of which I
complain.  It is assumed that the murder was committed at such a
position, and under such circumstances, that <hi rend="italics">the bearing it</hi> to the
river became necessary.  Now, the assassination might have taken
place upon the river's brink, or on the river itself; and, thus, the
throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to, at any
period of the day or night, as the most obvious and most immediate
mode of disposal.  You will understand that I suggest nothing here as
probable, or as cöincident with my own opinion.  My design, so
far, has no reference to the <hi rend="italics">facts</hi> of the case.  I wish merely to caution
you against the whole tone of L'Etoile's <hi rend="italics">suggestion</hi>, by calling your
attention to its <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> character at the outset.</p>
          <p>“Having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived
notions; having assumed that, if this were the body of Marie, it
could have been in the water but a very brief time; the journal goes
on to say:</p>
          <pb id="poe168" n="168"/>
          <p>‘All experience has shown that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown into
the water immediately after death by violence, require from six to ten
days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top
of the water.  Even when a cannon is fired over a corpse, and it rises
before at least five or six days' immersion, it sinks again if let alone.’</p>
          <p>“These assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in
Paris, with the exception of Le Moniteur.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" target="note21">*</ref>  This latter print
endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has
reference to ‘drowned bodies’ only, by citing some five or six
instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned
were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon
by L'Etoile.  But there is something excessively unphilosophical in
the attempt on the part of Le Moniteur, to rebut the general
assertion of L'Etoile, by a citation of particular instances militating
against that assertion.  Had it been possible to adduce fifty instead of
five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three
days, these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded
only as exceptions to L'Etoile's rule, until such time as the rule itself
should be confuted.  Admitting the rule, (and this Le Moniteur does
not deny, insisting merely upon its exceptions,) the argument of
L'Etoile is suffered to remain in full force; for this argument does not
pretend to involve more than a question of the <hi rend="italics">probability</hi> of the
body having risen to the surface in less than three days; and this
probability will be in favor of L'Etoile's position until the instances
so childishly adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an
antagonistical rule.</p>
          <p>“You will see at once that all argument upon this head should be
urged, if at all, against the rule itself; and for this end we must
examine the <hi rend="italics">rationale</hi> of the rule.  Now the human body, in general,
is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the
Seine; that is to say, the specific gravity of the human body, in its
natural condition, is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it
displaces. The bodies of fat and fleshy persons, with small bones,
and of women generally, are lighter than those of the lean and
large-boned, and of men; and the specific gravity of the water of a
river is somewhat influenced by the
<note id="note21" n="21" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref21">*The “N. Y. Commercial Advertiser,” edited by Col. Stone.</note>
<pb id="poe169" n="169"/>
presence of the tide from sea.  But, leaving this tide out of question,
it may be said that <hi rend="italics">very</hi> few human bodies will sink at all, even
in fresh water, <hi rend="italics">of their own accord.</hi>  Almost any one, falling
into a river, will be enabled to float, if he suffer the specific gravity
of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own—that
is to say, if he suffer his whole person to be immersed, with as little
exception as possible.  The proper position for one who cannot
swim, is the upright position of the walker on land, with the head
thrown fully back, and immersed; the mouth and nostrils alone
remaining above the surface.  Thus circumstanced, we shall find that
we float without difficulty and without exertion.  It is evident,
however, that the gravities of the body, and of the bulk of water
displaced, are very nicely balanced, and that a trifle will cause either
to preponderate.  An arm, for instance, uplifted from the water, and
thus deprived of its support, is an additional weight sufficient to
immerse the whole head, while the accidental aid of the smallest
piece of timber will enable us to elevate the head so as to look about.
Now, in the struggles of one unused to swimming, the arms are
invariably thrown upwards, while an attempt is made to keep the
head in its usual perpendicular position.  The result is the immersion
of the mouth and nostrils, and the inception, during efforts to
breathe while beneath the surface, of water into the lungs. Much is
also received into the stomach, and the whole body becomes heavier
by the difference between the weight of the air originally distending
these cavities, and that of the fluid which now fills them. This
difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink, as a general rule;
but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an
abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter. Such individuals float
even after drowning.</p>
          <p>“The corpse, being. supposed at the bottom of the river, will
there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes
less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect is
brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of
decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular
tissues and all the cavities, and giving the <hi rend="italics">puffed</hi> appearance which is
to horrible.  When this distension has so far progressed that the
bulk of the corpse is materially increased with.
<pb id="poe170" n="170"/>
out a corresponding increase of <hi rend="italics">mass</hi> or weight, its specific gravity
becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes
its appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by
innumerable circumstances—is hastened or retarded by innumerable
agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the
mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or
shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of
the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death.
Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like
accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition.
Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within
an hour; under others, it might not take place at all. There are
chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved
<hi rend="italics">forever</hi> from corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But,
apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a
generation of gas within the stomach, from the acetous fermentation
of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes)
sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the
surface. The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of
simple vibration. This may either loosen the corpse from the soft
mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise
when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing; or it may
overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular
tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.</p>
          <p>“Having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject, we
can easily test by it the assertions of L'Etoile.  ‘All experience
shows,’ says this paper, ‘that drowned bodies, or bodies thrown
into the water immediately after death by violence, require from
six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring
them to the top of the water.  Even when a cannon is fired over a
corpse, and it rises before at least five or six days' immersion, it
sinks again if let alone.’</p>
          <p>“The whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of inconsequence
and incoherence.  All experience <hi rend="italics">does</hi> not show that ‘drowned bodies’
<hi rend="italics">require</hi> from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place
to bring them to the surface.  Both science and experience show that
the period of their rising is, and
<pb id="poe171" n="171"/>
necessarily must be, indeterminate.  If, moreover, a body has risen to
the surface through firing of cannon, it will <hi rend="italics">not</hi> ‘sink again if let
alone,’ until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the
escape of the generated gas.  But I wish to call your attention to
the distinction which is made between ‘drowned bodies,’ and ‘bodies
thrown into the water immediately after death by violence.’
Although the writer admits the distinction, he yet includes them all
in the same category. I have shown how it is that the body of a
drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water,
and that he would not sink at all, except for the struggles by which
he elevates his arms above the surface, and his gasps for breath
while beneath the surface—gasps which supply by water the place
of the original air in the lungs.  But these struggles and these gasps
would not occur in the body ‘thrown into the water immediately after
death by violence.’  Thus, in the latter instance, <hi rend="italics">the body, as a
general rule, would not sink at all</hi>—a fact of which L'Etoile is
evidently ignorant.  When decomposition had proceeded to a very
great extent—when the flesh had in a great measure left the
bones—then, indeed, but not <hi rend="italics">till</hi> then, should we lose sight of the
corpse.</p>
          <p>“And now what are we to make of the argument, that the body
found could not be that of Marie Rogêt, because, three days only
having elapsed, this body was found floating?  If drowned, being
a woman, she might never have sunk; or having sunk, might have
reappeared in twenty-four hours, or less.  But no one supposes her
to have been drowned; and, dying before being thrown into the
river, she might have been found floating at any period afterwards
whatever.</p>
          <p>“ ‘But,’ says L'Etoile, ‘if the body had been kept in its mangled
state on shore until Tuesday night, some trace would be found on
shore of the murderers.’  Here it is at first difficult to perceive
the intention of the reasoner.  He means to anticipate what he
imagines would be an objection to his theory—viz: that the body
was kept on shore two days, suffering rapid decomposition—<hi rend="italics">more</hi>
rapid than if immersed in water.  He supposes that, had this been
the case, it <hi rend="italics">might</hi> have appeared at the surface on the Wednesday,
and thinks that <hi rend="italics">only</hi> under such circumstances it could so have
appeared.  He is accordingly in haste to show that
<pb id="poe172" n="172"/>
it <hi rend="italics">was not</hi> kept on shore; for, if so, ‘some trace would be found on
shore of the murderers.’  I presume you smile at the <hi rend="italics">sequitur.</hi>  You
cannot be made to see how the mere <hi rend="italics">duration</hi> of the corpse on the
shore could operate to <hi rend="italics">multiply traces</hi> of the assassins.  Nor can I.</p>
          <p>“ ‘And furthermore it is exceedingly improbable,’ continues our
journal, ‘that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here
supposed, would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it,
when such a precaution could have so easily been taken.’  Observe,
here, the laughable confusion of thought!  No one—not even L'Etoile
—disputes the murder committed <hi rend="italics">on the body found.</hi> The marks of
violence are too obvious.  It is our reasoner's object merely to show
that this body is not Marie's. He wishes to prove that <hi rend="italics">Marie</hi> is not
assassinated—not that the corpse was not. Yet his observation proves
only the latter point.  Here is a corpse without weight attached.
Murderers, casting it in, would not have failed to attach a weight.
Therefore it was not thrown in by murderers. This is all which is
proved, if any thing is.  The question of identity is not even
approached, and L'Etoile has been at great pains merely to gainsay
now what it has admitted only a moment before.  ‘We are perfectly
convinced,’ it says, ’that the body found was that of a murdered
female.‘</p>
          <p>“Nor is this the sole instance, even in this division of his subject,
where our reasoner unwittingly reasons against himself.  His evident
object, I have already said, is to reduce, us much as possible, the
interval between Marie's disappearance and the finding of the corpse.
Yet we find him <hi rend="italics">urging</hi> the point that no person saw the girl from
the moment of her leaving her mother's house.  ‘We have no evidence,’
he says, ‘that Marie Rogêt was in the land of the living after nine
o'clock on Sunday, June the twenty-second.’  As his argument is
obviously an <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> one, he should, at least, have left this matter
out of sight; for had any one been known to see Marie, say on Monday,
or on Tuesday, the interval in question would have been much reduced,
and, by his own ratiocination, the probability much diminished of
the corpse being that of the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">grisette.</hi></foreign>  It is, nevertheless, amusing to
<pb id="poe173" n="173"/>
observe that L'Etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its
furthering its general argument.</p>
          <p>“Reperuse now that portion of this argument which has reference to the
identification of the corpse by Beauvais.  In regard to the <hi rend="italics">hair</hi> upon
the arm, L'Etoile has been obviously disingenuous.  M. Beauvais, not
being an idiot, could never have urged, in identification of the corpse,
simply <hi rend="italics">hair upon its arm.</hi>  No arm is <hi rend="italics">without</hi> hair.  The <hi rend="italics">generality</hi> of
the expression of L'Etoile is a mere perversion of the witness'
phraseology.  He must have spoken of some <hi rend="italics">peculiarity</hi> in this hair.  It
must have been a peculiarity of color, of quantity, of length, or of
situation.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Her foot,’ says the journal, ‘was small—so are thousands of feet.
Her garter is no proof whatever—nor is her shoe—for shoes and
garters are sold in packages.  The same may be said of the flowers in
her hat.  One thing upon which M. Beauvais strongly insists is, that the
clasp on the garter found, had been set back to take it in.  This amounts
to nothing; for most women find it proper to take a pair of garters
home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to encircle, rather
than to try them in the store where they purchase.’ Here it is difficult
to suppose the reasoner in earnest. Had M. Beauvais, in his search for
the body of Marie, discovered a corpse corresponding in general size
and appearance to the missing girl, he would have been warranted
(without reference to the question of habiliment at all) in forming an
opinion that his search had been successful. If, in addition to the
point of general size and contour, he had found upon the arm a peculiar
hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living Marie, his
opinion might have been justly strengthened; and the increase of
positiveness might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity, or
unusualness, of the hairy mark. If, the feet of Marie being small,
those of the corpse were also small, the increase of probability that
the body was that of Marie would not be an increase in a ratio merely
arithmetical, but in one highly geometrical, or accumulative.  Add to
all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her
disappearance, and, although these shoes may be ‘sold in packages,’
you so far augment the probability as to verge upon the certain.
What, of
<pb id="poe174" n="174"/>
itself, would be no evidence of identity, becomes through its
corroborative position, proof most sure. Give us, then, flowers in
the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl, and we seek
for nothing farther. If only one flower, we seek for nothing farther
—what then if two or three, or more?  Each successive one is multiple
evidence—proof not <hi rend="italics">added</hi> to proof, but <hi rend="italics">multiplied</hi> by hundreds or
thousands. Let us now discover, upon the deceased, garters such as the
living used, and it is almost folly to proceed. But these garters are
found to be tightened, by the setting back of a clasp, in just such a
manner as her own had been tightened by Marie, shortly previous to her
leaving home.  It is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt. What L'Etoile
says in respect to this abbreviation of the garter's being an usual
occurrence, shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error.  The
elastic nature of the clasp-garter is self-demonstration of the
<hi rend="italics">unusualness</hi> of the abbreviation.  What is made to adjust itself, must
of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely.  It must have been
by an accident, in its strictest sense, that these garters of Marie
needed the tightening described.  They alone would have amply
established her identity.  But it is not that the corpse was found to
have the garters of the missing girl, or found to have her shoes, or
her bonnet, or the flowers of her bonnet, or her feet, or a peculiar
mark upon the arm, or her general size and appearance—it is that
the corpse had each, and <hi rend="italics">all collectively.</hi>  Could it be proved that
the editor of L'Etoile <hi rend="italics">really</hi> entertained a doubt, under the
circumstances, there would be no need, in his case, of a commission
<foreign lang="spa" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">de lunatico inquirendo.</hi></foreign>  He has thought it sagacious to echo the
small talk of the lawyers, who, for the most part, content themselves
with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts. I would here
observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court,
is the best of evidence to the intellect. For the court, guiding
itself by the general principles of evidence—the recognized and
<hi rend="italics">booked</hi> principles—is averse from swerving at particular instances.
And this steadfast adherence to principle, with rigorous disregard
of the conflicting exception, is a sure mode of attaining the <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi>
of attainable truth, in any long sequence of time. The practice, in
<hi rend="italics">mass</hi>, is therefore philosophical;
<pb id="poe175" n="175"/>
but it is not the less certain that it engenders vast individual 
error.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" target="note22">*</ref></p>
          <p>“In respect to the insinuations levelled at Beauvais, you will be
willing to dismiss them in a breath.  You have already fathomed the
true character of this good gentleman.  He is a <hi rend="italics">busy-body</hi>, with much
of romance and little of wit.  Any one so constituted will readily so
conduct himself, upon occasion of <hi rend="italics">real</hi> excitement, as to render
himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over acute, or the ill-
disposed.  M. Beauvais (as it appears from your notes) had some
personal interviews with the editor of L'Etoile, and offended him by
venturing an opinion that the corpse, notwithstanding the theory of
the editor, was, in sober fact, that of Marie. ‘He persists,’ says the
paper, ‘in asserting the corpse to be that of Marie, but cannot give a
circumstance, in addition to those which we have commented upon,
to make others believe.’  Now, without re-adverting to the fact that
stronger evidence ‘to make others believe,’ could <hi rend="italics">never</hi> have been
adduced, it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood
to believe, in a case of this kind, without the ability to advance
a single reason for the belief of a second party.  Nothing is more
vague than impressions of individual identity.  Each man recognizes
his neighbor, yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared
to <hi rend="italics">give a reason</hi> for his recognition.  The editor of L'Etoile had no
right to be offended at M. Beauvais' unreasoning belief.</p>
          <p>“The suspicious circumstances which invest him, will be found
to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic busy-bodyism,
than with the reasoner's suggestion of guilt.  Once adopting the
more charitable interpretation, we shall find no difficulty in
comprehending the rose in the key-hole; the ‘Marie’ upon the
<note id="note22" n="22" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref22">“A theory based on the qualities of an object, will prevent its
being unfolded according to its objects; and he who arranges topics

their results.  Thus the jurisprudence of every nation will show that,

errors into which a blind devotion to <hi rend="italics">principles</hi> of classification has
led the common law, will be seen by observing how often the legislature

lost.”—<hi rend="italics">Landor.</hi></note>
<pb id="poe176" n="176"/>
slate; the ‘elbowing the male relatives out of the way;’ the ‘aversion
to permitting them to see the body;’ the caution given to Madame B----,
that she must hold no conversation with the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">gendarme</hi></foreign> until his
return (Beauvais'); and, lastly, his apparent determination ‘that
nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except
himself.’  It seems to me unquestionable that Beauvais was a suitor of
Marie's; that she coquetted with him; and that he was ambitious of
being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence.  I shall
say nothing more upon this point; and, as the evidence fully rebuts
the assertion of L'Etoile, touching the matter of <hi rend="italics">apathy</hi> on the part
of the mother and other relatives—an apathy inconsistent with the
supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the perfumery-
girl—we shall now proceed as if the question of <hi rend="italics">identity</hi> were settled
to our perfect satisfaction.”</p>
          <p>“And what,” I here demanded, “do you think of the opinions of
Le Commerciel?”</p>
          <p>“That, in spirit, they are far more worthy of attention than any
which have been promulgated upon the subject.  The deductions from
the premises are philosophical and acute; but the premises, in two
instances, at least, are founded in imperfect observation.  Le
Commerciel wishes to intimate that Marie was seized by some gang
of low ruffians not far from her mother's door.  ‘It is impossible,’
it urges, ‘that a person so well known to thousands as this young
woman was, should have passed three blocks without some one having
seen her.’ This is the idea of a man long resident in Paris—a
public man—and one whose walks to and fro in the city, have been
mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices.  He is aware
that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own <hi rend="italics">bureau</hi>, without being recognized and accosted. And, knowing the extent of
his personal acquaintance with others, and of others with him, he
compares his notoriety with that of the perfumery-girl, finds no
great difference between them, and reaches at once the conclusion
that she, in her walks, would be equally liable to recognition with
himself in his. This could only be the case were her walks of the
same unvarying, methodical character, and within the same
<hi rend="italics">species</hi> of limited region as are his own.  He passes to and fro, at
regular intervals,
<pb id="poe177" n="177"/>
within a confined periphery, abounding in individuals who are led to
observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of
his occupation with their own. But the walks of Marie may, in
general, be supposed discursive. In this particular instance, it will
be understood as most probable, that she proceeded upon a route of
more than average diversity from her accustomed ones. The parallel
which we imagine to have existed in the mind of Le Commerciel
would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals' traversing
the whole city. In this case, granting the personal acquaintances to
be equal, the chances would be also equal that an equal number of
personal rencounters would be made.  For my own part, I should
hold it not only as possible, but as very far more than probable,
that Marie might have proceeded, at any given period, by any one
of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt,
without meeting a single individual whom she knew, or by whom
she was known.  In viewing this question in its full and proper light,
we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the
personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in Paris,
and the entire population of Paris itself.</p>
          <p>“But whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of
Le Commerciel, will be much diminished when we take into consideration
<hi rend="italics">the hour</hi> at which the girl went abroad.  ‘It was when the streets were
full of people,’ says Le Commerciel, ‘that she went out.’  But not so.
It was at nine o'clock in the morning.  Now at nine o'clock of every
morning in the week, <hi rend="italics">with the exception of Sunday</hi>, the streets of the
city are, it is true, thronged with people.  At nine on Sunday, the
populace are chiefly within doors <hi rend="italics">preparing for church.</hi>  No observing
person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the
town, from about eight until ten on the morning of every Sabbath.
Between ten and eleven the streets are thronged, but not at so early
a period as that designated.</p>
          <p>“There is another point at which there seems a deficiency of
<hi rend="italics">observation</hi> on the part of Le Commerciel.  ‘A piece,’ it says, ‘of
one of the unfortunate girl's petticoats, two feet long, and one foot
wide, was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the back of
her head, probably to prevent screams.  This was done,
<pb id="poe178" n="178"/>
by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.’  Whether this idea is,
or is not well founded, we will endeavor to see hereafter; but by
‘fellows who have no pocket-handkerchiefs’ the editor intends the
lowest class of ruffians.  These, however, are the very description
of people who will always be found to have handkerchiefs even
when destitute of shirts. You must have had occasion to observe
how absolutely indispensable, of late years, to the thorough
blackguard, has become the pocket-handkerchief.”</p>
          <p>“And what are we to think,” I asked, “of the article in Le Soleil?”</p>
          <p>“That it is a vast pity its inditer was not born a parrot—in
which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his
race. He has merely repeated the individual items of the already 
published opinion; collecting them, with a laudable industry, from
this paper and from that.  ‘The things had all <hi rend="italics">evidently</hi> been there,’
he says,‘at least, three or four weeks, and there can be <hi rend="italics">no doubt</hi>
that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered.’  The
facts here re-stated by Le Soleil, are very far indeed from removing
my own doubts upon this subject, and we will examine them more
particularly hereafter in connexion with another division of the
theme.</p>
          <p>“At present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations 
You cannot fail to have remarked the extreme laxity of the
examination of the corpse.  To be sure, the question of identity was
readily determined, or should have been; but there were other points
to be ascertained.  Had the body been in any respect <hi rend="italics">despoiled</hi>?  Had
the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving
home? if so, had she any when found?  These are important questions
utterly untouched by the evidence; and there are others of equal
moment, which have met with no attention.  We must endeavor to satisfy
ourselves by personal inquiry. The case of St. Eustache must be
re-examined.  I have no suspicion of this person; but let us proceed
methodically.  We will ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the
<hi rend="italics">affidavits</hi> in regard to his whereabouts on the Sunday.  Affidavits of
this character are readily made matter of mystification.  Should there
be nothing wrong here, however, we will dismiss St. Eustache from our
investigations.  His suicide, however corroborative
<pb id="poe179" n="179"/>
of suspicion, were there found to be deceit in the affidavits, is,
without such deceit, in no respect an unaccountable circumstance, or
one which need cause us to deflect from the line of ordinary analysis.</p>
          <p>“In that which I now propose, we will discard the interior points of
this tragedy, and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts.  Not
the least usual error, in investigations such as this, is the limiting
of inquiry to the immediate, with total disregard of the collateral or
circumstantial events.  It is the mal-practice of the courts to confine
evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy.  Yet
experience has shown, and a true philosophy will always show, that
a vast, perhaps the larger portion of truth, arises from the seemingly
irrelevant.  It is through the spirit of this principle, if not
precisely through its letter, that modern science has resolved to
<hi rend="italics">calculate upon the unforeseen.</hi>  But perhaps you do not comprehend
me. The history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown
that to collateral, or incidental, or accidental events we are
indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries, that
it has at length become necessary, in any prospective view of
improvement, to make not only large, but the largest allowances for
inventions that shall arise by chance, and quite out of the range of
ordinary expectation.  It is no longer philosophical to base, upon
what has been, a vision of what is to be.  <hi rend="italics">Accident</hi> is admitted as a
portion of the substructure.  We make chance a matter of absolute
calculation.  We subject the unlooked for and unimagined, to the
mathematical <hi rend="italics">formulae</hi> of the schools.</p>
          <p>“I repeat that it is no more than fact, that the <hi rend="italics">larger</hi> portion of
all truth has sprung from the collateral; and it is but in accordance
with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact, that I
would divert inquiry, in the present case, from the trodden and
hitherto unfruitful ground of the event itself, to the contemporary
circumstances which surround it.  While you ascertain the validity
of the affidavits, I will examine the newspapers more generally
than you have as yet done.  So far, we have only reconnoitred the
field of investigation; but it will be strange indeed if a
comprehensive survey, such as I propose, of the public prints,
<pb id="poe180" n="180"/>
will not afford us some minute points which shall establish a <hi rend="italics">direction</hi>
for inquiry.”</p>
          <p>In pursuance of Dupin's suggestion, I made scrupulous examination of
the affair of the affidavits. The result was a firm conviction of their
validity, and of the consequent innocence of St. Eustache. In the mean
time my friend occupied himself, with what seemed to me a minuteness
altogether objectless, in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files.  At
the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts:</p>
          <p>“About three years and a half ago, a disturbance very similar to the
present, was caused by the disappearance of this same Marie Rogêt,
from the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">parfumerie</hi></foreign> of Monsieur Le Blanc, in the Palais Royal.  At the
end of a week, however, she re-appeared at her customary <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi>comptoir</hi></foreign>, as
well as ever, with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether
usual.  It was given out by Monsieur Le Blanc and her mother, that she
had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country; and the
affair was speedily hushed up.  We presume that the present absence is
a freak of the same nature, and that, at the expiration of a week, or
perhaps of a month, we shall have her among us again.”—<hi rend="italics">Evening Paper—Monday June 23.</hi><ref targOrder="U" id="ref23" n="23" target="note23">*</ref></p>
          <p>“An evening journal of yesterday, refers to a former mysterious
disappearance of Mademoiselle Rogêt.  It is well known that, during
the week of her absence from Le Blanc's <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">parfumerie</hi></foreign>, she was in the
company of a young naval officer, much noted for his debaucheries.  A
quarrel, it is supposed, providentially led to her return home.  We
have the name of the Lothario in question, who is, at present, stationed
in Paris, but, for obvious reasons, forbear to make it public.”

river.  Upon reaching the opposite shore, the three passengers stepped
out, and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat,
when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol.  She
returned for it, was seized by the gang, carried out into the stream,
gagged, brutally treated, and finally taken to the shore at a point not

          <p>Upon reading these various extracts, they not only seemed to me
irrelevant, but I could perceive no mode in which any one of them
could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand.  I waited for
some explanation from Dupin.</p>
          <p>“It is not my present design,” he said, “to <hi rend="italics">dwell</hi> upon the first
and second of those extracts.  I have copied them chiefly to show
you the extreme remissness of the police, who, as far as I can
understand from the Prefect, have not troubled themselves, in any
respect, with an examination of the naval officer alluded to.  Yet it
is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance
of Marie, there is no <hi rend="italics">supposable</hi> connection.  Let us admit the first
elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers, and the
return home of the betrayed.  We are now prepared to view a second
<hi rend="italics">elopement</hi> (if we <hi rend="italics">know</hi> that an elopement has again taken place) as
indicating a renewal of the betrayer's advances, rather than as the
result of new proposals by a second individual—we are prepared to
regard it as a ‘making up’ of the old <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">amour</hi></foreign>, rather than as the
commencement of a new one.  The chances are ten to one, that he
who had once eloped

<pb id="poe182" n="182"/>
with Marie, would again propose an elopement, rather than that
she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual,
should have them made to her by another.  And here let me call your
attention to the fact, that the time elapsing between the first
ascertained, and the second supposed elopement, is a few months
more than the general period of the cruises of our men-of-war.  Had
the lover been interrupted in his first villany by the necessity of
departure to sea, and had he seized the first moment of his return
to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished—or not
yet altogether accomplished <hi rend="italics">by him</hi>?  Of all these things we know
nothing.</p>
          <p>“You will say, however, that, in the second instance, there was
<hi rend="italics">no</hi> elopement as imagined.  Certainly not—but are we prepared to
say that there was not the frustrated design?  Beyond St. Eustache,
and perhaps Beauvais, we find no recognized, no open, no honorable
suitors of Marie.  Of none other is there any thing said.  Who, then,
is the secret lover, of whom the relatives (<hi rend="italics">at least most of them</hi>)
know nothing, but whom Marie meets upon the morning of Sunday, and
who is so deeply in her confidence, that she hesitates not to remain
with him until the shades of the evening descend, amid the solitary
groves of the Barrière du Roule?  Who is that secret lover, I ask, of
whom, at least, <hi rend="italics">most</hi> of the relatives know nothing?  And what means
the singular prophecy of Madame Rogêt on the morning of Marie's
departure? —‘I fear that I shall never see Marie again.’</p>
          <p>“But if we cannot imagine Madame Rogêt privy to the design of
elopement, may we not at least suppose this design entertained by
the girl?  Upon quitting home, she gave it to be understood that she
was about to visit her aunt in the Rue des Drômes and St. Eustache
was requested to call for her at dark.  Now, at first glance, this
fact strongly militates against my suggestion;—but let us reflect.
That she <hi rend="italics">did</hi> meet some companion, and proceed with him across the
river, reaching the Barrière du Roule at so late an hour as three
o'clock in the afternoon, is known.  But in consenting so to
accompany this individual, (<hi rend="italics">for whatever purpose—to her mother
known or unknown,</hi>) she must have thought of her expressed
intention when leaving home, and of the surprise and suspicion
aroused in the bosom of her affianced suitor, St. Eustache,
<pb id="poe183" n="183"/>
when, calling for her, at the hour appointed, in the Rue
des Drômes, he should find that she had not been there, and when,
moreover, upon returning to the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">pension</hi></foreign> with this alarming
intelligence, he should become aware of her continued absence from
home.  She must have thought of these things, I say.  She must have
foreseen the chagrin of St. Eustache, the suspicion of all.  She
could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion; but
the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her, if we
suppose her not intending to return.</p>
          <p>“We may imagine her thinking thus—‘I am to meet a certain
person for the purpose of elopement, or for certain other purposes
known only to myself.  It is necessary that there be no chance of
interruption—there must be sufficient time given us to elude
pursuit—I will give it to be understood that I shall visit and
spend the day with my aunt at the Rue des Drômes—I well tell St.
Eustache not to call for me until dark—in this way, my absence
from home for the longest possible period, without causing suspicion
or anxiety, will be accounted for, and I shall gain more time than
in any other manner.  If I bid St. Eustache call for me at dark, he
will be sure not to call before; but, if I wholly neglect to bid him
call, my time for escape will be diminished, since it will be expected
that I return the earlier, and my absence will the sooner excite
anxiety.  Now, if it were my design to return <hi rend="italics">at all</hi>—if I had in
contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question—it
would not be my policy to bid St. Eustache call; for, calling, he will
be <hi rend="italics">sure</hi> to ascertain that I have played him false—a fact of which
I might keep him for ever in ignorance, by leaving home without
notifying him of my intention, by returning before dark, and by then
stating that I had been to visit my aunt in the Rue des Drômes.  But,
as it is my design <hi rend="italics">never</hi> to return—or not for some weeks—or
not until certain concealments are effected—the gaining of time is
the only point about which I need give myself any concern.’</p>
          <p>“You have observed, in your notes, that the most general opinion
in relation to this sad affair is, and was from the first, that
the girl had been the victim of <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi> of blackguards. Now, the
popular opinion, under certain conditions, is not to be disregarded.
When arising of itself—when manifesting itself in a strictly
<pb id="poe184" n="184"/>
spontaneous manner—we should look upon it as analogous with that
<hi rend="italics">intuition</hi> which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius.
In ninety-nine cases from the hundred I would abide by its decision.
But it is important that we find no palpable traces of <hi rend="italics">suggestion.</hi>
The opinion must be rigorously <hi rend="italics">the public's own</hi>; and the distinction is
often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain.  In the present
instance, it appears to me that this ‘public opinion’ in respect to <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi>, has been superinduced by the collateral event which is detailed
in the third of my extracts.  All Paris is excited by the discovered
corpse of Marie, a girl young, beautiful and notorious.  This corpse is
found, bearing marks of violence, and floating in the river.  But it is
now made known that, at the very period, or about the very period,
in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated, an outrage
similar in nature to that endured by the deceased, although less in
extent, was perpetuated, by a gang of young ruffians, upon the
person of a second young female.  Is it wonderful that the one known
atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the
other unknown?  This judgment awaited direction, and the known
outrage seemed so opportunely to afford it!  Marie, too, was found
in the river; and upon this very river was this known outrage
committed.  The connexion of the two events had about it so much of
the palpable, that the true wonder would have been a <hi rend="italics">failure</hi> of the
populace to appreciate and to seize it.  But, in fact, the one atrocity,
known to be so committed, is, if any thing, evidence that the other,
committed at a time nearly coincident, was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> so committed.  It
would have been a miracle indeed, if, while a gang of ruffians were
perpetrating, at a given locality, a most unheard-of wrong, there
should have been another similar gang, in a similar locality, in the
same city, under the same circumstances, with the same means and
appliances, engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect, at
precisely the same period of time!  Yet in what, if not in this
marvellous train of coincidence, does the accidentally <hi rend="italics">suggested</hi>
opinion of the populace call upon us to believe?</p>
          <p>“Before proceeding farther, let us consider the supposed scene of
the assassination, in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule.  This
thicket, although dense, was in the close vicinity of a public road.
<pb id="poe185" n="185"/>
Within were three or four large stones, forming a kind of seat with
a back and footstool.  On the upper stone was discovered a white
petticoat; on the second, a silk scarf.  A parasol, gloves, and a
pocket-handkerchief, were also here found.  The handkerchief bore
the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’  Fragments of dress were seen on the
branches around.  The earth was trampled, the bushes were broken,
and there was every evidence of a violent struggle.</p>
          <p>“Notwithstanding the acclamation with which the discovery of this
thicket was received by the press, and the unanimity with which it
was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage, it must
be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt.  That it
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> the scene, I may or I may not believe—but there was excellent
reason for doubt.  Had the <hi rend="italics">true</hi> scene been, as Le Commerciel suggested,
in the neighborhood of the Rue Pavée St. Andrée, the perpetrators of
the crime, supposing them still resident in Paris, would naturally
have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely
directed into the proper channel; and, in certain classes of minds,
there would have arisen, at once, a sense of the necessity of some
exertion to redivert this attention.  And thus, the thicket of the
Barrière du Roule having been already suspected, the idea of placing
the articles where they were found, might have been naturally
entertained.  There is no real evidence, although Le Soleil so supposes,
that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the
thicket; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not
have remained there, without attracting attention, during the twenty
days elapsing between the fatal Sunday and the afternoon upon which
they were found by the boys.  ‘They were all <hi rend="italics">mildewed</hi> down hard,’ says
Le Soleil, adopting the opinions of its predecessors, ‘with the action
of the rain, and stuck together from <hi rend="italics">mildew.</hi>  The grass had grown
around and over some of them.  The silk of the parasol was strong,
but the threads of it were run together within.  The upper part,
where it bad been doubled and folded, was all <hi rend="italics">mildewed</hi> and rotten,
and tore on being opened.’  In respect to the grass having ‘.grown
around and over some of them,’ it is obvious that the fact could only
have been ascertained from the words, and thus from the recollections,
of two small boys;
<pb id="poe186" n="186"/>
for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they
had been seen by a third party.  But grass will grow, especially in
warm and damp weather, (such as was that of the period of the
murder,) as much as two or three inches in a single day.  A parasol
lying upon a newly turfed ground, might, in a single week, be
entirely concealed from sight by the upspringing grass.  And
touching that <hi rend="italics">mildew</hi> upon which the editor of Le Soleil so
pertinaciously insists, that he employs the word no less than three
times in the brief paragraph just quoted, is be really unaware of the
nature of this <hi rend="italics">mildew</hi>?  Is he to be told that it is one of the many
classes of <hi rend="italics">fungus</hi>, of which the most ordinary feature is its
upspringing and decadence within twenty-four hours?”</p>
          <p>Thus we see, at a glance, that what has been most triumphantly
adduced in support of the idea that the articles bad been ‘for at least
three or four weeks’ in the thicket, is most absurdly null as regards
any evidence of that fact.  On the other hand, it is exceedingly
difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the
thicket specified, for a longer period than a single week—for a
longer period than from one Sunday to the next.  Those who know
any thing of the vicinity of Paris, know the extreme difficulty of
finding <hi rend="italics">seclusion</hi> unless at a great distance from its suburbs.  Such
a thing as an unexplored, or even an unfrequently visited recess,
amid its woods or groves, is not for a moment to be imagined.  Let any
one who, being at heart a lover of nature, is yet chained by duty to
the dust and heat of this great metropolis—let any such one attempt,
even during the weekdays, to slake his thirst for solitude amid the
scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us. At
every second step, he will find the growing charm dispelled by the
voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing
blackguards.  He will seek privacy amid the densest foliage, all in vain.
Here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound—here are
the temples most desecrate.  With sickness of the heart the wanderer
will flee back to the polluted Paris as to a less odious because less
incongruous sink of pollution.  But if the vicinity of the city is so
beset during the working days of the week, how much more so on
the Sabbath!  It is now especially that, released from the claims
of labor, or deprived of the customary opportunities of
<pb id="poe187" n="187"/>
crime, the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town, not
through love of the rural, which in his heart he despises, but by way
of escape from the restraints and conventionalities of society.  He
desires less the fresh air and the green trees, than the utter <hi rend="italics">license</hi>
of the country.  Here, at the road-side inn, or beneath the foliage of
the woods, he indulges, unchecked by any eye except those of his
boon companions, in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity—the
joint offspring of liberty and of rum.  I say nothing more than what
must be obvious to every dispassionate observer, when I repeat that
the circumstance of the articles in question having remained
undiscovered, for a longer period—than from one Sunday to another,
in <hi rend="italics">any</hi> thicket in the immediate neighborhood of Paris, is to be looked
upon as little less than miraculous.</p>
          <p>“But there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that
the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of diverting
attention from the real scene of the outrage.  And, first, let me direct
your notice to the <hi rend="italics">date</hi> of the discovery of the articles.  Collate this
with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the
newspapers.  You will find that the discovery followed, almost
immediately, the urgent communications sent to the evening paper.
These communications, although various and apparently from
various sources, tended all to the same point—viz., the directing of
attention to <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi> as the perpetrators of the outrage, and to the
neighborhood of the Barrière du Roule as its scene.  Now here, of
course, the suspicion is not that, in consequence of these
communications, or of the public attention by them directed, the
articles were found by the boys; but the suspicion might and may
well have been, that the articles were not <hi rend="italics">before</hi> found by the boys,
for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket;
having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date, or
shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty
authors of these communications themselves.</p>
          <p>“This thicket was a singular—an exceedingly singular one.  It was
unusually dense.  Within its naturally walled enclosure were three
extraordinary stones, <hi rend="italics">forming a seat with a back and footstool.</hi>  And
this thicket, so full of a natural art, was in the immediate vicinity,
<hi rend="italics">within a few rods</hi>, of the dwelling of Madame
<pb id="poe188" n="188"/>
Deluc, whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the
shrubberies about them in search of the bark of the sassafras.  Would
it be a rash wager—a wager of one thousand to one—that <hi rend="italics">a day</hi>
never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least
one of them ensconced in the umbrageous hall, and enthroned upon
its natural throne?  Those who would hesitate at such a wager, have
either never been boys themselves, or have forgotten the boyish
nature.  I repeat—it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the
articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered, for a longer
period than one or two days; and that thus there is good ground for
suspicion, in spite of the dogmatic ignorance of Le Soleil, that they
were, at a comparatively late date, deposited where found.</p>
          <p>“But there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them
so deposited, than any which I have as yet urged.  And, now, let me
beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles.
On the <hi rend="italics">upper</hi> stone lay a white petticoat; on the <hi rend="italics">second</hi> a silk scarf;
scattered around, were a parasol, gloves, and a pocket-handkerchief
bearing the name, ‘Marie Rogêt.’  Here is just such an arrangement as
would <hi rend="italics">naturally</hi> be made by a not over-acute person wishing to
dispose the articles <hi rend="italics">naturally.</hi>  But it is by no means a <hi rend="italics">really</hi> natural
arrangement.  I should rather have looked to see the things <hi rend="italics">all</hi> lying
on the ground and trampled under foot.  In the narrow limits of that
bower, it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and
scarf should have retained a position upon the stones, when subjected
to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons.  ‘There was
evidence,’ it is said, ‘of a struggle; and the earth was trampled,
the bushes were broken,’—but the petticoat and the scarf are
found deposited as if upon shelves.  ‘The pieces of the frock torn
out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches
long.  One part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended.
They <hi rend="italics">looked like strips torn off.</hi>’  Here, inadvertently, Le Soleil
has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase.  The pieces, as
described, do indeed ‘look like strips torn off;’ but purposely and
by hand.  It is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is ‘torn
off,’ from any garment such as is now in question, by the agency
<hi rend="italics">of a thorn.</hi>  From the very nature of such fabrics, a thorn or
<pb id="poe189" n="189"/>
nail becoming entangled in them, tears them rectangularly—divides
them into two longitudinal rents, at right angles with each other,
and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters—but it is scarcely
possible to conceive the piece ‘torn off.’  I never so knew it, nor did
you.  To tear a piece <hi rend="italics">off</hi> from such fabric, two distinct forces, in
different directions, will be, in almost every case, required.  If there
be two edges to the fabric—if, for example, it be a pocket-
handkerchief, and it is desired to tear from it a slip, then, and then
only, will the one force serve the purpose.  But in the present case
the question is of a dress, presenting but one edge.  To tear a piece
from the interior, where no edge is presented, could only be effected
by a miracle through the agency of thorns, and no <hi rend="italics">one</hi> thorn could
accomplish it.  But, even where an edge is presented, two thorns will
be necessary, operating, the one in two distinct directions, and the
other in one.  And this in the supposition that the edge is unhemmed.
If hemmed, the matter is nearly out of the question.  We thus see the
numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being ‘torn off’
through the simple agency of ‘thorns;’ yet we are required to believe
not only that one piece but that many have been so torn.  ‘And one
part,’ too, ‘<hi rend="italics">was the hem of the frock!</hi>’  Another piece was ‘<hi rend="italics">part of
the skirt, not the hem,</hi>’—that is to say, was torn completely out
through the agency of thorns, from the uncaged interior of the dress!
These, I say, are things which one may well be pardoned for disbelieving;
yet, taken collectedly, they form, perhaps, less of reasonable ground
for suspicion, than the one startling circumstance of the articles'
having been left in this thicket at all, by any <hi rend="italics">murderers</hi> who had
enough precaution to think of removing the corpse.  You will not have
apprehended me rightly, however, if you suppose it my design to deny
this thicket as the scene of the outrage.  There might have been a
wrong <hi rend="italics">here,</hi> or, more possibly, an accident at Madame Deluc's.  But, in
fact, this is a point of minor importance.  We are not engaged in an
attempt to discover the scene, but to produce the perpetrators of the
murder.  What I have adduced, notwithstanding the minuteness with which
I have adduced it, has been with the view, first, to show the folly of
the positive and headlong assertions of Le Soleil, but secondly and
chiefly, to bring you, by the most natural route, to
<pb id="poe190" n="190"/>
a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination
has, or has not been, the work of a gang.</p>
          <p>“We will resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting
details of the surgeon examined at the inquest.  It is only 
necessary to say that is published <hi rend="italics">inferences,</hi> in regard to the
number of ruffians, have been properly ridiculed as unjust and
totally baseless, by all the reputable anatomists of Paris.  Not
that the matter <hi rend="italics">might not</hi> have been as inferred, but that there
was no ground for the inference:—was there not much for another?</p>
          <p>“Let us reflect now upon ‘the traces of a struggle;’ and let me
ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate.  A gang.
But do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang?  What
<hi rend="italics">struggle</hi> could have taken place—what struggle so violent and so
enduring as to have left its ‘traces’ in all directions—between a
weak and defenceless girl and the <hi rend="italics">gang</hi> of ruffians imagined?  The
silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over.  The
victim must have been absolutely passive at their will.  You will here
bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the
scene, are applicable in chief part, only against it as the scene of
an outrage committed by <hi rend="italics">more than a single individual. </hi> If we imagine
but <hi rend="italics">one</hi> violator, we can conceive, and thus only conceive, the
struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the
‘traces’ apparent.</p>
          <p>“And again.  I have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited
by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain <hi rend="italics">at all</hi> in the thicket where discovered.  It seems almost impossible that
these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where
found.  There was sufficient presence of mind (it is supposed) to
remove the corpse; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse
itself (whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay,)
is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage—I
allude to the handkerchief with the <hi rend="italics">name</hi> of the deceased.  If this
was accident, it was not the accident <hi rend="italics">of a gang.</hi>  We can imagine it
only the accident of an individual.  Let us see.  An individual has
committed the murder.  He is alone with the ghost of the departed.
He is appalled by what lies motionless before him.  The fury of his
passion is over,
<pb id="poe191" n="191"/>
and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the
deed.  His is none of that confidence which the presence of numbers
inevitably inspires.  He is <hi rend="italics">alone</hi> with the dead.  He trembles and is
bewildered.  Yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse.
He bears it to the river, but leaves behind him the other evidences
of guilt; for it is difficult, if not impossible to carry all the burthen at
once, and it will be easy to return for what is left.  But in his toilsome
journey to the water his fears redouble within him.  The sounds of life
encompass his path.  A dozen times he hears or fancies the step of
an observer.  Even the very lights from the city bewilder him.  Yet,
in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony, he reaches
the river's brink, and disposes of his ghastly charge—perhaps
through the medium of a boat.  But <hi rend="italics">now</hi> what treasure does the
world hold—what threat of vengeance could it hold out—which
would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over
that toilsome and perilous path, to the thicket and its blood chilling
recollections?  He returns <hi rend="italics">not,</hi> let the consequences be what they
may.  He <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not return if he would.  His sole thought is
immediate escape.  He turns his back <hi rend="italics">forever</hi> upon those dreadful
shrubberies and flees as from the wrath to come.</p>
          <p>“But how with a gang?  Their number would have inspired them
with confidence; if, indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast
of the arrant blackguard; and of arrant blackguards alone are the
supposed <hi rend="italics">gangs</hi> ever constituted.  Their number, I say, would have
prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which I have
imagined to paralyze the single man.  Could we suppose an
oversight in one, or two, or three, this oversight would have been
remedied by a fourth.  They would have left nothing behind them;
for their number would have enabled them to carry <hi rend="italics">all</hi> at once.
There would have been no need of <hi rend="italics">return.</hi></p>
          <p>“Consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the
corpse when found, ‘a slip, about a foot wide had been torn
upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round
the waist, and secured by a sort of hitch in the back.’  This was
done with the obvious design of affording <hi rend="italics">a handle</hi> by which to
carry the body.  But would any <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of men hare dreamed of
resorting to such an expedient?  To three or four, the limbs of
<pb id="poe192" n="192"/>
the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient, but the best
possible hold.  The device is that of a single individual; and this
brings us to the fact that ‘between the thicket and the river, the rails
of the fences were found taken down, and the ground bore evident
traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it!’  But
would a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble
of taking down a fence, for the purpose of dragging through it a
corpse which they might have <hi rend="italics">lifted over</hi> any fence in an instant?
Would a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of men have so <hi rend="italics">dragged</hi> a corpse at all as to have
left evident <hi rend="italics">traces</hi> of the dragging?</p>
          <p>“And here we must refer to an observation of Le Commerciel; an
observation upon which I have already, in some measure,
commented.  ‘A piece,’ says this journal, ‘of one of the unfortunate
girl's petticoats was torn out and tied under her chin, and around the
back of her head, probably to prevent screams. This was done by
fellows who had no pocket-handkerchiefs.’</p>
          <p>“I have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never <hi rend="italics">without</hi> a
pocket-handkerchief.  But it is not to this fact that I now especially
advert.  That it was not through want of a handkerchief for the
purpose imagined by Le Commerciel, that this bandage was
employed, is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the
thicket; and that the object was not ‘to prevent screams’ appears,
also, from the bandage having been employed in preference to what
would so much better have answered the purpose.  But the language
of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as ‘found around the
neck, fitting loosely, and secured with a hard knot.’  These words are
sufficiently vague, but differ materially from those of Le Commerciel.
The slip was eighteen inches wide, and therefore, although of muslin,
would form a strong band when folded or rumpled longitudinally.
And thus rumpled it was discovered.  My inference is this.  The
solitary murderer, having borne the corpse, for some distance,
(whether from the thicket or elsewhere) by means of the bandage
<hi rend="italics">hitched</hi> around its middle, found the weight, in this mode of procedure,
too much for his strength.  He resolved to drag the burthen—the
evidence goes to show that it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> dragged.  With this object in view,
it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the
extremities.  It could be best attached about the neck, where the
<pb id="poe193" n="193"/>
head would prevent its slipping off.  And, now, the murderer
bethought him, unquestionably, of the bandage about the loins.  He
would have used this, but for its volution about the corpse, the <hi rend="italics">hitch</hi>
which embarrassed it, and the reflection that it had not been ‘torn off’
from the garment.  It was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat.
He tore it, made it fast about the neck, and so <hi rend="italics">dragged</hi> his victim to
the brink of the river.  That this ‘bandage,’ only attainable with
trouble and delay, and but imperfectly answering its purpose—that
this bandage was employed <hi rend="italics">at all</hi>, demonstrates that the necessity
for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period
when the handkerchief was no longer attainable—that is to say,
arising, as we have imagined, after quitting the thicket, (if the thicket
it was), and on the road between the thicket and the river.</p>
          <p>“But the evidence, you will say, of Madame Deluc, (!) points
especially to the presence of <hi rend="italics">a gang,</hi> in the vicinity of the thicket, at
or about the epoch of the murder.  This I grant. I doubt if there were
not a <hi rend="italics">dozen</hi> gangs, such as described by Madame Deluc, in and about
the vicinity of the Barrière du Roule at <hi rend="italics">or about</hi> the period of this
tragedy.  But the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed
animadversion, although the somewhat tardy and very suspicious
evidence of Madame Deluc, is the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> gang which is represented by
that honest and scrupulous old lady as having eaten her cakes and
swallowed her brandy, without putting themselves to the trouble
of making her payment.  <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Et hinc illæ iræ?</hi></foreign></p>
          <p>“But what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the precise evidence of Madame Deluc?  ‘A gang of
miscreants made their appearance, behaved boisterously, ate and
drank without making payment, followed in the route of the young
man and girl, returned to the inn <hi rend="italics">about dusk,</hi> and recrossed the
river as if in great haste.’</p>
          <p>“Now this ‘great haste’ very possibly seemed <hi rend="italics">greater</hi> haste in the
eyes of Madame Deluc, since she dwelt lingeringly and lamentingly
upon her violated cakes and ale—cakes and ale for which she might
still have entertained a faint hope of compensation.  Why,
otherwise, since it was <hi rend="italics">about dusk,</hi> should she make a point of the
<hi rend="italics">haste?</hi>  It is no cause for wonder, surely, that even a gang of
blackguards should make <hi rend="italics">haste</hi> to get home,
<pb id="poe194" n="194"/>
when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats, when storm
impends, and when night approaches.</p>
          <p>“I say <hi rend="italics">approaches</hi>; for the night had <hi rend="italics">not yet arrived.</hi>  It was only
<hi rend="italics">about dusk</hi> that the indecent haste of these ‘miscreants’ offended the
sober eyes of Madame Deluc.  But we are told that it was upon this
very evening that Madame Deluc, as well as her eldest son, ‘heard the
screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn.’  And in what words
does Madame Deluc designate the period of the evening at which
these screams were heard?  ‘It was <hi rend="italics">soon after dark</hi>,’ she says.  But
‘soon <hi rend="italics">after</hi> dark,’ is, at least, <hi rend="italics">dark</hi>; and‘<hi rend="italics">about dusk</hi>’ is as certainly
daylight.  Thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the Barrière
du Roule <hi rend="italics">prior</hi> to the screams overheard (?) by Madame Deluc.
And although, in all the many reports of the evidence, the relative
expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just
as I have employed them in this conversation with yourself, no
notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has, as yet, been taken by
any of the public journals, or by any of the Myrmidons of police.</p>
          <p>“I shall add but one to the arguments against <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi>; but this <hi rend="italics">one</hi>
has, to my own understanding at least, a weight altogether
irresistible.  Under the circumstances of large reward offered, and
full pardon to any King's evidence, it is not to be imagined, for a
moment, that some member of <hi rend="italics">a gang</hi> of low ruffians, or of any
body of men, would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices.
Each one of a gang so placed, is not so much greedy of reward,
or anxious for escape, as <hi rend="italics">fearful of betrayal.</hi>  He betrays eagerly
and early that <hi rend="italics">he may not himself be betrayed.</hi>  That the secret
has not been divulged, is the very best of proof that it is, in fact,
a secret. The horrors of this dark deed are known only to <hi rend="italics">one,</hi>
or two, living human beings, and to God.</p>
          <p>“Let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long
analysis.  We have attained the idea either of a fatal accident
under the roof of Madame Deluc, or of a murder perpetrated,
in the thicket at the Barrière du Roule, by a lover, or at least by
an intimate and secret associate of the deceased.  This associate
is of swarthy complexion. This complexion, the ‘hitch’ in the
<pb id="poe195" n="195"/>
bandage, and the ‘sailor's knot,’ with which the bonnet-ribbon is
tied, point to a seaman.  His companionship with the deceased, a
gay, but not an abject young girl, designates him as above the
grade of the  common sailor.  Here the well written and urgent
communications to the journals are much in the way of
corroboration.  The circumstance of the first elopement, as
mentioned by Le Mercurie, tends to blend the idea of this seaman
with that of the ‘naval officer’ who is first known to have led the
unfortunate into crime.</p>
          <p>“And here, most fitly, comes the consideration of the continued
absence of him of the dark complexion.  Let me pause to observe
that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy; it was no
common swarthiness which constituted the <hi rend="italics">sole</hi> point of
remembrance, both as regards Valence and Madame Deluc.  But
why is this man absent?  Was he murdered by the gang?  If so,
why are there only <hi rend="italics">traces</hi> of the assassinated <hi rend="italics">girl</hi>?  The scene of the
two outrages will naturally be supposed identical.  And where is his
corpse?  The assassins would most probably have disposed of both
in the same way.  But it may be said that this man lives, and is
deterred from making himself known, through dread of being
charged with the murder.  This consideration might be supposed to
operate upon him now—at this late period—since it has been given
in evidence that he was seen with Marie—but it would have had no
force at the period of the deed.  The first impulse of an innocent man
would have been to announce the outrage, and to aid in identifying
the ruffians.  This <hi rend="italics">policy</hi> would have suggested.  He had been seen
with the girl.  He had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat.
The denouncing of the assassins would have appeared, even
to an idiot, the surest and sole means of relieving himself from
suspicion.  We cannot suppose him, on the night of the fatal
Sunday, both innocent himself and incognizant of an outrage
committed.  Yet only under such circumstances is it possible to
imagine that he would have failed, if alive, in the denouncement of
the assassins.</p>
          <p>“And what means are ours, of attaining the truth?  We shall find
these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed.
Let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement.
<pb id="poe196" n="196"/>
Let us know the full history of ‘the officer,’ with his present
circumstances, and his whereabouts at the precise period of the
murder.  Let us carefully compare with each other the various
communications sent to the evening paper, in which the object was to
inculpate <hi rend="italics">a gang.</hi>  This done, let us compare these communications,
both as regards style and MS., with those sent to the morning paper,
at a previous period, and insisting so vehemently upon the
guilt of Mennais.  And, all this done, let us again compare these
various communications with the known MSS. of the officer.  Let us
endeavor to ascertain, by repeated questionings of Madame Deluc
and her boys, as well as of the omnibus driver, Valence, something
more of the personal appearance and bearing of the ‘man of dark
complexion.’  Queries, skilfully directed, will not fail to elicit, from
some of these parties, information on this particular point (or upon
others)—information which the parties themselves may not even be
aware of possessing.  And let us now trace <hi rend="italics">the boat</hi> picked up by the
bargeman on the morning of Monday the twenty-third of June, and
which was removed from the barge-office, without the cognizance of
the officer in attendance, and <hi rend="italics">without the rudder</hi>, at some period
prior to the discovery of the corpse.  With a proper caution and
perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat; for not only can the
bargeman who picked it up identify it, but the <hi rend="italics">rudder is at hand.</hi>  The
rudder <hi rend="italics">of a sail-boat</hi> would not have been abandoned, without
inquiry, by one altogether at ease in heart.  And here let me pause to
insinuate a question.  There was no <hi rend="italics">advertisement</hi> of the picking up
of this boat.  It was silently taken to the barge-office, and as silently
removed.  But its owner or employer—how <hi rend="italics">happened</hi> he, at so early a
period as Tuesday morning, to be informed, without the agency of
advertisement, of the locality of the boat taken up on Monday,
unless we imagine some connexion with the <hi rend="italics">navy</hi>—some personal
permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in interests—
its petty local news?</p>
          <p>“In speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the
shore, I have already suggested the probability of his availing
himself <hi rend="italics">of a boat.</hi>  Now we are to understand that Marie Rogêt
<hi rend="italics">was</hi> precipitated from a boat.  This would naturally have been
<pb id="poe197" n="197"/>
the case.  The corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow
waters of the shore.  The peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of
the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat.  That the body was found
without weight is also corroborative of the idea.  If thrown from the
shore a weight would have been attached.  We can only account for its
absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution
of supplying himself with it before pushing off.  In the act of
consigning the corpse to the water, he would unquestionably have
noticed his oversight; but then no remedy would have been at hand.
Any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed
shore.  Having rid himself of his ghastly charge, the murderer would
have hastened to the city.  There, at some obscure wharf, he would
have leaped on land.  But the boat—would he have secured it?  He
would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat.
Moreover, in fastening it to the wharf, he would have felt as if
securing evidence against himself.  His natural thought would have
been to cast from him, as far as possible, all that had held connection
with his crime.  He would not only have fled from the wharf, but he
would not have permitted <hi rend="italics">the boat</hi> to remain.  Assuredly he
would have cast it adrift.  Let us pursue our fancies.—In the
morning, the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that
the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in
the daily habit of frequenting—at a locality, perhaps, which his duty
compels him to frequent.  The next night, <hi rend="italics">without daring to ask for
the rudder</hi>, he removes it.  Now <hi rend="italics">where</hi> is that rudderless boat?  Let it
be one of our first purposes to discover.  With the first glimpse we
obtain of it, the dawn of our success shall begin.  This boat shall guide
us, with a rapidity which will surprise even ourselves, to him who
employed it in the midnight of the fatal Sabbath.  Corroboration will
rise upon corroboration, and the murderer will be traced.”</p>
          <p>[For reasons which we shall not specify, but which to many
readers will appear obvious, we have taken the liberty of here
omitting, from the MSS. placed in our hands, such portion as details
the <hi rend="italics">following up</hi> of the apparently slight clew obtained by Dupin.
We feel it advisable only to state, in brief, that the result desired
was brought to pass; and that the Prefect fulfilled
<pb id="poe198" n="198"/>
punctually, although with reluctance, the terms of his compact with
the Chevalier.  Mr. Poe's article concludes with the following
words.—<hi rend="italics">Eds.</hi><ref targOrder="U" id="ref30" n="30" target="note30">*</ref>]</p>
          <p>It will be understood that I speak of coincidences <hi rend="italics">and no more.</hi>
What I have said above upon this topic must suffice.  In my own
heart there dwells no faith in præter-nature.  That Nature and its
God are two, no man who thinks, will deny.  That the latter,
creating the former, can, at will, control or modify it, is also
unquestionable.  I say “at will;” for the question is of will, and not,
as the insanity of logic has assumed, of power.  It is not that the
Deity <hi rend="italics">cannot</hi> modify his laws, but that we insult him in imagining a
possible necessity for modification.  In their origin these laws were
fashioned to embrace <hi rend="italics">all</hi> contingencies which <hi rend="italics">could</hi> lie in the Future.
With God all is <hi rend="italics">Now.</hi></p>
          <p>I repeat, then, that I speak of these things only as of coincidences.
And farther: in what I relate it will be seen that between the fate of
the unhappy Mary Cecilia Rogers, so far as that fate is known, and
the fate of one Marie Rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history,
there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful
exactitude the reason becomes embarrassed.  I say all this will be
seen.  But let it not for a moment be supposed that, in proceeding
with the sad narrative of Marie from the epoch just mentioned, and
in tracing to its <hi rend="italics">dénouement</hi> the mystery which enshrouded her, it is
my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel, or
even to suggest that the measures adopted in Paris for the discovery
of the assassin of a <foreign lang="fre">grisette</foreign>, or measures founded in any similar
ratiocination, would produce any similar result.</p>
          <p>For, in respect to the latter branch of the supposition, it should
be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two
cases might give rise to the most important miscalculations, by
diverting thoroughly the two courses of events; very much as, in
arithmetic, an error which, in its own individuality, may be
inappreciable, produces, at length, by dint of multiplication at all
points of the process, a result enormously at variance with truth.
And, in regard to the former branch, we must not fail to hold in
<note id="note30" n="30" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref30">* Of the Magazine in which the article was originally published</note>
<pb id="poe199" n="199"/>
view that the very Calculus of Probabilities to which I have referred,
forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel:—forbids it with a
positiveness strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has
already been long-drawn and exact.  This is one of those anomalous
propositions which, seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart
from the mathematical, is yet one which only the mathematician can
fully entertain.  Nothing, for example, is more difficult than to
convince the merely general reader that the fact of sixes having been
thrown twice in succession by a player at dice, is sufficient cause for
betting the largest odds that sixes will not be thrown in the third
attempt.  A suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the
intellect at once.  It does not appear that the two throws which have
been completed, and which lie now absolutely in the Past, can have
influence upon the throw which exists only in the Future.  The chance
for throwing sixes seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary
time—that is to say, subject only to the influence of the various
other throws which may be made by the dice.  And this is a reflection
which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to controvert it
are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything
like respectful attention.  The error here involved—a gross error
redolent of mischief—I cannot pretend to expose within the limits
assigned me at present; and with the philosophical it needs no
exposure.  It may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an
infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path or Reason through
her propensity for seeking truth <hi rend="italics">in detail.</hi></p>

          <p>At Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18--,
I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum,
in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back
library, or book-closet, <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">au troisiême</hi></foreign>, No. 33, <hi rend="italics">Rue Dunôt,
Faubourg St. Germain.</hi>  For one hour at least we had maintained a
profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might
have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling
eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.  For
myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which
had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period
of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery
attending the murder of Marie Rogêt.  I looked upon it, therefore, as
something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was
thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G----, the
Prefect of the Parisian police.</p>
          <p>We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much
of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had
not seen him for several years.  We had been sitting in the dark, and
Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down
again, without doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to
consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some
official business which had occasioned  a great deal of trouble.</p>
          <pb id="poe201" n="201"/>
          <p>“If it is any point requiring reflection,” observed Dupin, as he
forebore to enkindle the wick, “we shall examine it to better
purpose in the dark.”</p>
          <p>“That is another of your odd notions,” said the Prefect, who had
a fashion of calling every thing “odd” that was beyond his
comprehension, and thus lived amid an absolute legion of “oddities.”</p>
          <p>“Very true,” said Dupin, as he supplied his visiter with a pipe,
and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.</p>
          <p>“And what is the difficulty now?” I asked.  “Nothing more in
the assassination way, I hope?”</p>
          <p>“Oh no; nothing of that nature.  The fact is, the business is
<hi rend="italics">very</hi> simple indeed, and I make no doubt that we can manage it
sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like
to hear the details of it, because it is so excessively <hi rend="italics">odd</hi>.”</p>
          <p>“Simple and odd,” said Dupin.</p>
          <p>“Why, yes; and not exactly that, either.  The fact is, we have all
been a good deal puzzled because the affair <hi rend="italics">is</hi> so simple, and yet
baffles us altogether.”</p>
          <p>“Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at
fault,” said my friend.</p>
          <p>“What nonsense you <hi rend="italics">do</hi> talk!” replied the Prefect, laughing
heartily.</p>
          <p>“Perhaps the mystery is a little <hi rend="italics">too</hi> plain,” said Dupin.</p>
          <p>“Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?”</p>
          <p>“A little <hi rend="italics">too</hi> self-evident.”</p>
          <p>“Ha! ha! ha—ha! ha! ha!—ho! ho! ho!” roared our visiter,
profoundly amused, “oh, Dupin, you will be the death of me yet!”</p>
          <p>“And what, after all, <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the matter on hand?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Why, I will tell you,” replied the Prefect, as he gave a long,
steady and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair.  “I
will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you
that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I
should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known
that I confided it to any one.”</p>
          <p>“Proceed,” said I.</p>
          <p>“Or not,” said Dupin.</p>
          <pb id="poe202" n="202"/>
          <p>“Well, then; I have received personal information, from a very
high quarter, that a certain document of the last importance, has
been purloined from the royal apartments.  The individual who
purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it.
It is known, also, that it still remains in his possession.”</p>
          <p>“How is this known?” asked Dupin.</p>
          <p>“It is clearly inferred,” replied the Prefect, “from the nature of
the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which
would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession;
that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the
end to employ it.”</p>
          <p>“Be a little more explicit,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Well, I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its
holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is
immensely valuable.”  The Prefect was fond of the cant of
diplomacy.</p>
          <p>“Still I do not quite understand,” said Dupin.</p>
          <p>“No?  Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person,
who shall be nameless, would bring in question the honor of a
personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder
of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose
honor and peace are so jeopardized.”</p>
          <p>“But this ascendancy,” I interposed, “would depend upon the
robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the robber.  Who
would dare —”</p>
          <p>“The thief,” said G., “is the Minister D----, who dares all things,
those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.  The method of
the theft was not less ingenious than bold.  The document in question
—a letter, to be frank—had been received by the personage
robbed while alone in the royal <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">boudoir</hi></foreign>.  During its perusal she was
suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage
from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.  After a hurried
and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place
it, open as it was, upon a table.  The address, however, was
uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped
notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D----.  His lynx eye
immediately perceives
<pb id="poe203" n="203"/>
the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes
the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her
secret.  After some business transactions, hurried through in his
ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in
question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close
juxtaposition to the other.  Again he converses, for some fifteen
minutes, upon the public affairs.  At length, in taking leave, he takes
also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.  Its rightful
owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the
presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.  The
minister decamped; leaving his own letter—one of no
importance—upon the table.”</p>
          <p>“Here, then,” said Dupin to me, “you have precisely what you
demand to make the ascendancy complete—the robber's knowledge
of the loser's knowledge of the robber.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” replied the Prefect; “and the power thus attained has, for
some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very
dangerous extent.  The personage robbed is more thoroughly
convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.
But this, of course, cannot be done openly.  In fine, driven to
despair, she has committed the matter to me.”</p>
          <p>“Than whom,” said Dupin, amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke, “no
more sagacious agent could, I suppose, be desired, or even
imagined.”</p>
          <p>“You flatter me,” replied the Prefect; “but it is possible that
some such opinion may have been entertained.”</p>
          <p>“It is clear,” said I, “as you observe, that the letter is still in
possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any
employment of the letter, which bestows the power.  With the
employment the power departs.”</p>
          <p>“True,” said G.; “and upon this conviction I proceeded.  My first
care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here
my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without
his knowledge.  Beyond all things, I have been warned of the danger
which would result from giving him reason to suspect our
design.”</p>
          <p>“But,” said I, “you are quite <hi rend="italics">au fait</hi> in these investigations.  The
Parisian police have done this thing often before.”</p>
          <pb id="poe204" n="204"/>
          <p>“O yes; and for this reason I did not despair.  The habits of the
minister gave me, too, a great advantage.  He is frequently absent
from home all night.  His servants are by no means numerous.  They
sleep at a distance from their master's apartment, and, being
chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk.  I have keys, as you
know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris.  For
three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which
I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D---- Hotel.
My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is
enormous.  So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully
satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.  I fancy
that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in
which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.”</p>
          <p>“But is it not possible,” I suggested, “that although the letter
may be in possession of the minister, as it unquestionably is, he
may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?”</p>
          <p>“This is barely possible,” said Dupin.  “The present peculiar
condition of affairs at court, and especially of those intrigues
in which D---- is known to be involved, would render the instant
availability of the document—its susceptibility of being produced
at a moment's notice—a point of nearly equal importance with its
possession.”</p>
          <p>“Its susceptibility of being produced?” said I.</p>
          <p>“That is to say, of being <hi rend="italics">destroyed</hi>,” said Dupin.</p>
          <p>“True,” I observed; “the paper is clearly then upon the premises.
As for its being upon the person of the minister, we may consider
that as out of the question.”</p>
          <p>“Entirely,” said the Prefect.  “He has been twice waylaid, as if
by footpads, and his person rigorously searched under my own
inspection.”</p>
          <p>“You might have spared yourself this trouble,” said Dupin.
“D----, I presume, is not altogether a fool, and, if not, must
have anticipated these waylayings, as a matter of course.”</p>
          <p>“Not <hi rend="italics">altogether</hi> a fool,” said G., “but then he's a poet, which I
take to be only one remove from a fool.”</p>
          <p>“True,” said Dupin, after a long and thoughtful whiff from
<pb id="poe205" n="205"/>
his meerschaum, “although I have been guilty of certain doggrel
myself.”</p>
          <p>“Suppose you detail,” said I, “the particulars of your search.”</p>
          <p>“Why the fact is, we took our time, and we searched <hi rend="italics">every where</hi>.  I
have had long experience in these affairs.  I took the entire building,
room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each.  We
examined, first, the furniture of each apartment.  We opened every
possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly
trained police agent, such a thing as a <hi rend="italics">secret</hi> drawer is impossible.
Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a
search of this kind.  The thing is <hi rend="italics">so</hi> plain.  There is a certain amount
of bulk—of space —to be accounted for in every cabinet.  Then we
have accurate rules.  The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.
After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with
the fine long needles you have seen me employ.  From the tables we
removed the tops.”</p>
          <p>“Why so?”</p>
          <p>“Sometimes the top of a table, or other similarly arranged piece
of furniture, is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article;
then the leg is excavated, the article deposited within the cavity, and
the top replaced.  The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed
in the same way.”</p>
          <p>“But could not the cavity be detected by sounding?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“By no means, if, when the article is deposited, a sufficient
wadding of cotton be placed around it.  Besides, in our case, we
were obliged to proceed without noise.”</p>
          <p>“But you could not have removed—you could not have taken to
pieces <hi rend="italics">all</hi> articles of furniture in which it would have been possible
to make a deposit in the manner you mention.  A letter may be
compressed into a thin spiral roll, not differing much in shape or
bulk from a large knitting-needle, and in this form it might be inserted
into the rung of a chair, for example.  You did not take to pieces all
the chairs?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly not; but we did better—we examined the rungs of
every chair in the hotel, and, indeed the jointings of every
description of furniture, by the aid of a most powerful microscope.
Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not
<pb id="poe206" n="206"/>
have failed to detect it instantly.  A single grain of gimlet-dust,
for example, would have been as obvious as an apple.  Any disorder
in the glueing—any unusual gaping in the joints—would have
sufficed to insure detection.”</p>
          <p>“I presume you looked to the mirrors, between the boards and the
plates, and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes, as well as
the curtains and carpets.”</p>
          <p>“That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every
particle of the furniture in this way, then we examined the house
itself.  We divided its entire surface into compartments, which we
numbered, so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each
individual square inch throughout the premises, including the two
houses immediately adjoining, with the microscope, as before.”</p>
          <p>“The two houses adjoining!” I exclaimed; “you must have had a
great deal of trouble.”</p>
          <p>“We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!”</p>
          <p>“You include the <hi rend="italics">grounds</hi> about the houses?”</p>
          <p>“All the grounds are paved with brick.  They gave us comparatively
little trouble.  We examined the moss between the bricks, and
found it undisturbed.”</p>
          <p>“You looked among D----'s papers, of course, and into the books of
the library?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only
opened every book, but we turned over every leaf in each volume,
not contenting ourselves with a mere shake, according to the fashion
of some of our police officers.  We also measured the thickness of
every book-<hi rend="italics">cover</hi>, with the most accurate admeasurement, and
applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.  Had
any of the bindings been recently meddled with, it would have been
utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.
Some five or six volumes, just from the hands of the binder, we
carefully probed, longitudinally, with the needles.”</p>
          <p>“You explored the floors beneath the carpets?”</p>
          <p>“Beyond doubt.  We removed every carpet, and examined the boards
with the microscope.”</p>
          <p>“And the paper on the walls?”</p>
          <pb id="poe207" n="207"/>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“You looked into the cellars?”</p>
          <p>“We did.”</p>
          <p>“Then,” I said, “you have been making a miscalculation, and the
letter is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> upon the premises, as you suppose.”</p>
          <p>“I fear you are right there,” said the Prefect.  “And now, Dupin,
what would you advise me to do?”</p>
          <p>“To make a thorough re-search of the premises.”</p>
          <p>“That is absolutely needless,” replied G----.  “I am not more sure
that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.”</p>
          <p>“I have no better advice to give you,” said Dupin.  “You have, of
course, an accurate description of the letter?”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes!”—And here the Prefect, producing a memorandum-book
proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal, and
especially of the external appearance of the missing document.  Soon
after finishing the perusal of this description, he took his departure,
more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good
gentleman before.</p>
          <p>In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit, and found
us occupied very nearly as before.  He took a pipe and a chair and
entered into some ordinary conversation.  At length I said,—</p>
          <p>“Well, but G----, what of the purloined letter?  I presume you
have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as
overreaching the Minister?”</p>
          <p>“Confound him, say I—yes; I made the re-examination, however,
as Dupin suggested—but it was all labor lost, as I knew it would
be.”</p>
          <p>“How much was the reward offered, did you say?” asked Dupin.</p>
          <p>“Why, a very great deal—a <hi rend="italics">very</hi> liberal reward—I don't like to
say how much, precisely; but one thing I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> say, that I wouldn't
mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any
one who could obtain me that letter.  The fact is, it is becoming of
more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately
doubled.  If it were trebled, however, I could do no more than I
have done.”</p>
          <pb id="poe208" n="208"/>
          <p>“Why, yes,” said Dupin, drawlingly, between the whiffs of his
meerschaum, “I really—think, G----, you have not exerted
yourself—to the utmost in this matter.  You might—do a little
more, I think, eh?”</p>
          <p>“How?—in what way?<sic>‘</sic></p>
          <p>“Why—puff, puff—you might—puff, puff—employ counsel
in the matter, eh?—puff, puff, puff.  Do you remember the story
they tell of Abernethy?”</p>
          <p>“No; hang Abernethy!”</p>
          <p>“To be sure! hang him and welcome.  But, once upon a time, a
certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this
Abernethy for a medical opinion.  Getting up, for this purpose, an
ordinary conversation in a private company, he insinuated his case
to the physician, as that of an imaginary individual.</p>
          <p>“ ‘We will suppose,’ said the miser, ‘that his symptoms are such
and such; now, doctor, what would <hi rend="italics">you</hi> have directed him to take?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Take!’ said Abernethy, ‘why, take <hi rend="italics">advice</hi>, to be sure.’ ”</p>
          <p>“But,” said the Prefect, a little discomposed, “I am <hi rend="italics">perfectly</hi>
willing to take advice, and to pay for it.  I would <hi rend="italics">really</hi> give
fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.”</p>
          <p>“In that case,” replied Dupin, opening a drawer, and producing a
check-book, “you may as well fill me up a check for the amount
mentioned.  When you have signed it, I will hand you the letter.”</p>
          <p>I was astounded.  The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken.
For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless, looking
incredulously at my friend with open mouth, and eyes that seemed
starting from their sockets; then, apparently recovering himself
in some measure, he seized a pen, and after several pauses and
vacant stares, finally filled up and signed a check for fifty
thousand francs, and handed it across the table to Dupin.  The latter
examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then,
unlocking an <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">escritoire</hi></foreign>, took thence a letter and gave it to the
Prefect.  This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy,
opened it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents,
and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at length
unceremoniously from the room and
<pb id="poe209" n="209"/>
from the house, without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had
requested him to fill up the check.</p>
          <p>When he had gone, my friend entered into some explanations.</p>
          <p>“The Parisian police,” he said, “are exceedingly able in their
way.  They are persevering, ingenious, cunning, and thoroughly
versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand.
Thus, when G---- detailed to us his made of searching the premises
at the Hotel D----, I felt entire confidence in his having made a
satisfactory investigation—so far as his labors extended.”</p>
          <p>“So far as his labors extended?” said I.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said Dupin.  “The measures adopted were not only the best
of their kind, but carried out to absolute perfection.  Had the
letter been deposited within the range of their search, these
fellows would, beyond a question, have found it.”</p>
          <p>I merely laughed—but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.</p>
          <p>“The measures, then,” he continued, “ were good in their kind,
and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the
case, and to the man.  A certain set of highly ingenious resources are,
with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly
adapts his designs.  But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too
shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better
reasoner than he.  I knew one about eight years of age, whose
success at guessing in the game of ‘even and odd’ attracted universal
admiration.  This game is simple, and is played with marbles.  One
player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of
another whether that number is even or odd.  If the guess is right, the
guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude
won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle
of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of
the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is
his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, ‘are they even
or odd?’  Our schoolboy replies, ‘odd,’ and loses; but upon the
second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, ‘the simpleton had
them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just
sufficient to make him have them
<pb id="poe210" n="210"/>
odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;’—he guesses odd,
and wins.  Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would
have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I
guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon
the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the
first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is
too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it
even as before.  I will therefore guess even;’—he guesses even,
and wins.  Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his
fellows termed ‘lucky,’—what, in its last analysis, is it?”</p>
          <p>“It is merely,” I said, “an identification of the reasoner's
intellect with that of his opponent.”</p>
          <p>“It is,” said Dupin; “and, upon inquiring, of the boy by what
means he effected the <hi rend="italics">thorough</hi> identification in which his success
consisted, I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out
how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one,
or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of
my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression
of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my
mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.’
This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious
profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault, to La Bougive,
to Machiavelli, and to Campanella.”</p>
          <p>“And the identification,” I said, “of the reasoner's intellect with
that of his opponent, depends, if I understand you aright, upon the
accuracy with which the opponent's intellect is admeasured.”</p>
          <p>“For its practical value it depends upon this,” replied Dupin;
“and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by
default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement,
or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which
they are engaged. They consider only their <hi rend="italics">own</hi> ideas of ingenuity;
and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes
in which <hi rend="italics">they</hi> would have hidden it. They are right in this
much—that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of
that of <hi rend="italics">the mass</hi>; but when the cunning of the individual felon
<pb id="poe211" n="211"/>
is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course.
This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually
when it is below.  They have no variation of principle in their
investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency—by
some extraordinary reward—they extend or exaggerate their old
modes of <hi rend="italics">practice</hi>, without touching their principles. What, for
example, in this case of D----, has been done to vary the principle of
action?  What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and
scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the
building into registered square inches—what is it all but an
exaggeration <hi rend="italics">of the application</hi> of the one principle or set of
principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions
regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine
of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it
for granted that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> men proceed to conceal a letter,—not exactly in
a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg—but, at least, in <hi rend="italics">some</hi> out-of-the-way
hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which
would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a
chair-leg?  And do you not see also, that such <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">recherchés</hi></foreign> nooks for
concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be
adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment,
a disposal of the article concealed—a disposal of it in this <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">recherché</hi></foreign>
manner,—is, in the very first instance, presumable and presumed;
and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but
altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the
seekers; and where the case is of importance—or, what amounts to
the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude,
-- the qualities in question have <hi rend="italics">never</hi> been known to fail. You
will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the
purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the
Prefect's examination—in other words, had the principle of its
concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect
-- its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question.
This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and
the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the
Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet.  All
<pb id="poe212" n="212"/>
fools are poets; this the Prefect <hi rend="italics">feels</hi>; and he is merely guilty of a
<foreign lang="ita" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">non distributio medii</hi></foreign> in thence inferring that all poets are fools.”</p>
          <p>“But is this really the poet?” I asked.  “There are two brothers, I
know; and both have attained reputation in letters.  The Minister I
believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus.  He is a
mathematician, and no poet.”</p>
          <p>“You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both.  As poet <hi rend="italics">and</hi>
mathematician, he would reason well; as mere mathematician, he could
not have reasoned at all, and thus would have been at the mercy of the
Prefect.”</p>
          <p>“You surprise me,” I said, “by these opinions, which have been
contradicted by the voice of the world.  You do not mean to set at
naught the well-digested idea of centuries.  The mathematical reason
has long been regarded as <hi rend="italics">the</hi> reason <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">Il y a à parièr,</hi></foreign>’ ” replied Dupin, quoting from Chamfort, “ ‘<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">que
toute idée publique, toute convention reçue est une sottise, car elle
a convenue au plus grand nombre.</hi></foreign>’  The mathematicians, I grant you,
have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you
allude, and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as
truth.  With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have
insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into application to algebra.  The French
are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of
any importance—if words derive any value from applicability—then
‘analysis’ conveys ‘algebra’ about as much as, in Latin, ‘<foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">ambitus</hi></foreign>’
implies ‘ambition,’ ‘<foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">religio</hi></foreign>’ ‘religion,’ or ‘<foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">homines honesti</hi></foreign>,’ a set
of <hi rend="italics">honorable</hi> men.”</p>
          <p>“You have a quarrel on hand, I see,” said I, “with some of the
algebraists of Paris; but proceed.”</p>
          <p>“I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason
which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly
logical.  I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by 
mathematical study.  The mathematics are the science of form
and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to 
observation upon form and quantity.  The great error lies in
supposing that even the truths of what is called <hi rend="italics">pure</hi> algebra, are
abstract or general truths.  And this error is so egregious that I
<pb id="poe213" n="213"/>
am confounded at the universality with which it has been received.
Mathematical axioms are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> axioms of general truth.  What is true of
<hi rend="italics">relation</hi>—of form and quantity—is often grossly false in regard to
morals, for example.  In this latter science it is very usually <hi rend="italics">un</hi>true
that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole.  In chemistry also
the axiom fails.  In the consideration of motive it fails; for two
motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when
united, equal to the sum of their values apart.  There are numerous
other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of
<hi rend="italics">relation.</hi>  But the mathematician argues, from his <hi rend="italics">finite truths,</hi>
through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability
—as the world indeed imagines them to be.  Bryant, in his very
learned ‘Mythology,’ mentions an analogous source of error, when
he says that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet
we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as
existing realities.’  With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans
themselves, the ‘Pagan fables’ <hi rend="italics">are</hi> believed, and the inferences are
made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an
unaccountable addling of the brains.  In short, I never yet
encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of
equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of
his faith that <hi rend="italics">x2</hi>+<hi rend="italics">px</hi> was absolutely and unconditionally equal to <hi rend="italics">q.</hi>
Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please,
that you believe occasions may occur where <hi rend="italics">x2</hi>+<hi rend="italics">px</hi> is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> altogether
equal to <hi rend="italics">q,</hi> and, having made him understand what you mean, get
out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he
will endeavor to knock you down.</p>
          <p>“I mean to say,” continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his
last observations, “that if the Minister had been no more than a
mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of
giving me this check.  I know him, however, as both mathematician
and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with
reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded.  I knew
him as a courtier, too, and as a bold <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">intriguant.</hi></foreign>  Such a man, I
considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial
modes of action.  He could not have failed to anticipate—and
events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate—the
<pb id="poe214" n="214"/>
waylayings to which he was subjected.  He must have foreseen, I
reflected, the secret investigations of his premises.  His frequent
absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as
certain aids to his success, I regarded only as <hi rend="italics">ruses</hi>, to afford
opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner
to impress them with the conviction to which G---, in fact, did finally
arrive—the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises.  I
felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains
in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of
policial action in searches for articles concealed—I felt that this
whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of
the Minister.  It would imperatively lead him to despise all the
ordinary <hi rend="italics">nooks</hi> of concealment.  <hi rend="italics">He</hi> could not, I reflected, be so weak
as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel
would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the
probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect.  I saw,
in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to <hi rend="italics">simplicity</hi>, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice.  You will
remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I
suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this
mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so <hi rend="italics">very</hi>
self-evident.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said I, “I remember his merriment well.  I really thought he
would have fallen into convulsions.”</p>
          <p>“The material world,” continued Dupin, “abounds with very strict
analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been
given to the rhetorical dogma, that metaphor, or simile, may be
made to strengthen an argument, as well as to embellish a description.
The principle of the <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics">vis inertiæ</foreign>, for example, seems to be
identical in physics and metaphysics.  It is not more true in the
former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a
smaller one, and that its subsequent <hi rend="italics">momentum</hi> is commensurate with
this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the
vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more
eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet
the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of
hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.  Again:
<pb id="poe215" n="215"/>
have you ever noticed which of the street signs, over the shop-
doors, are the most attractive of attention?”</p>
          <p>“I have never given the matter a thought,” I said.</p>
          <p>“There is a game of puzzles,” he resumed, “which is played
upon a map.  One party playing requires another to find a given
word—the name of town, river, state or empire—any word, in
short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart.  A novice
in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving
them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such
words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the
other.  These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the
street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and
here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral
inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed
those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably
self-evident.  But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or
beneath the understanding of the Prefect.  He never once thought it
probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter
immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best
preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.</p>
          <p>“But the more I reflected upon the daring, dashing, and
discriminating ingenuity of D----; upon the fact that the document
must always have been <hi rend="italics">at hand</hi>, if he intended to use it to good
purpose; and upon the decisive evidence, obtained by the Prefect,
that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary's
ordinary search—the more satisfied I became that, to conceal
this letter, the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and
sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.</p>
          <p>“Full of these ideas, I prepared myself with a pair of green
spectacles, and called one fine morning, quite by accident, at the
Ministerial hotel.  I found D---- at home, yawning, lounging, and
dawdling, as usual, and pretending to be in the last extremity of
<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi>ennui</hi></foreign>.  He is, perhaps, the most really energetic human being now
alive—but that is only when nobody sees him.</p>
          <p>“To be even with him, I complained of my weak eyes, and lamented
the necessity of the spectacles, under cover of which
<pb id="poe216" n="216"/>
I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment, while
seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.</p>
          <p>“I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he
sat, and upon which lay confusedly, some miscellaneous letters and
other papers, with one or two musical instruments and a few books.
Here, however, after a long and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw
nothing to excite particular suspicion.</p>
          <p>“At length my eyes, in going the circuit of the room, fell upon a
trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard, that hung dangling by a
dirty blue ribbon, from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of
the mantel-piece.  In this rack, which had three or four compartments,
were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter.  This last was much
soiled and crumpled.  It was torn nearly in two, across the middle—as
if a design, in the first instance, to tear it entirely up as worthless,
had been altered, or stayed, in the second.  It had a large black seal,
bearing the D---- cipher <hi rend="italics">very</hi> conspicuously, and was addressed, in a 
diminutive female hand, to D----, the minister, himself.  It was thrust
carelessly, and even, as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the
uppermost divisions of the rack.</p>
          <p>“No sooner had I glanced at this letter, than I concluded it to be
that of which I was in search.  To be sure, it was, to all appearance,
radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so
minute a description.  Here the seal was large and black, with the
D---- cipher; there it was small and red, with the ducal arms of the
S---- family.  Here, the address, to the Minister, diminutive and
feminine; there the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was
markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence.
But, then, the <hi rend="italics">radicalness</hi> of these differences, which was excessive;
the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent
with the <hi rend="italics">true</hi> methodical habits of D----, and so suggestive of a design
to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the
document; these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation
of this document, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly
in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived;
these things, I say, were strongly
<pb id="poe217" n="217"/>
corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to
suspect.</p>
          <p>“I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained
a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I
knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my
attention really riveted upon the letter.  In this examination, I
committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the
rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest
whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained.  In scrutinizing the
edges of the paper, I observed them to be more <hi rend="italics">chafed</hi> than seemed
necessary.  They presented the <hi rend="italics">broken</hi> appearance which is
manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed
with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases
or edges which had formed the original fold.  This discovery was
sufficient.  It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a
glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed.  I bade the Minister good
morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box
upon the table.</p>
          <p>“The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed,
quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day.  While thus
engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard
immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded
by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob.
D---- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out.  In the
meantime, I stepped to the card-rack took the letter, put it in my
pocket, and replaced it by a <hi rend="italics">fac-simile</hi>, (so far as regards externals,)
which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings—imitating the
D---- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.</p>
          <p>“The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic
behavior of a man with a musket.  He had fired it among a crowd of
women and children.  It proved, however, to have been without ball,
and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard.
When he had gone, D---- came from the window, whither I had followed
him immediately upon securing the object in view.  Soon afterwards I
bade him farewell.  The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.”</p>
          <p>“But what purpose had you,” I asked, “in replacing the letter
<pb id="poe218" n="218"/>
by a <hi rend="italics">fac-simile</hi>?  Would it not have been better, at the first visit, to
have seized it openly, and departed?”</p>
          <p>“D----,” replied Dupin, “is a desperate man, and a man of nerve.  His
hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests.  Had
I made the wild attempt you suggest, I might never have left the
Ministerial presence alive.  The good people of Paris might have heard
of me no more.  But I had an object apart from these considerations.
You know my political prepossessions.  In this matter, I act as a
partisan of the lady concerned.  For eighteen months the Minister has
had her in his power.  She has now him in hers—since, being unaware
that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his
exactions as if it was.  Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at
once, to his political destruction.  His downfall, too, will not be more
precipitate than awkward.  It is all very well to talk about the <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">facilis
descensus Averni</hi></foreign>; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani said of
singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down.  In the
present instance I have no sympathy—at least no pity—for him
who descends.  He is that <foreign lang="lat" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">monstrum horrendum</hi></foreign>, an unprincipled man of
genius.  I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the
precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom
the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to opening the
letter which I left for him in the card-rack.”</p>
          <p>“How? did you put any thing particular in it?”</p>
          <p>“Why—it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank
—that would have been insulting.  D----, at Vienna once, did me an
evil turn, which I told him, quite good-humoredly, that I should
remember.  So, as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to
the identity of the person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity
not to give him a clue.  He is well acquainted with my MS., and I just
copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words—</p>

          <p>IT was well said of a certain German book that “<foreign lang="ger" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">er lasst sich
nicht lesen</hi></foreign>”—it does not permit itself to be
read.  There are some
secrets which do not permit themselves to be told.  Men die nightly
in their beds, wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking
them piteously in the eyes—die with despair of heart and
convulsion of throat, on account of the hideousness of mysteries
which will not <hi rend="italics">suffer themselves</hi> to be revealed.
Now and then, alas,
the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it
can be thrown down only into the grave.  And thus the essence of all
crime is undivulged.</p>
          <p>Not long ago, about the closing in of an evening in autumn, I sat
at the large bow window of the D---- Coffee-House in London.
For some months I had been ill in health, but was now convalescent,
and, with returning strength, found myself in one of those happy
moods which are so precisely the converse of 
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">ennui</hi></foreign>—moods of the
keenest appetency, when the film from the mental vision departs—the <foreign lang="gre">αχλυς ος πριν επηεν</foreign>—and the intellect,
electrified, surpasses
as greatly its every-day condition, as does the vivid yet candid
reason of Leibnitz, the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias.  Merely
to breathe was enjoyment; and I derived positive pleasure even
from many of the legitimate sources of pain.  I felt a calm but
inquisitive interest in every thing.  With a cigar in my mouth and
a newspaper in my lap, I had been amusing myself for the greater
part of the afternoon, now in
<pb id="poe220" n="220"/>
poring over advertisements, now in observing the promiscuous
company in the room, and now in peering through the smoky panes
into the street.</p>
          <p>This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city, and
had been very much crowded during the whole day.  But, as the
darkness came on, the throng momently increased; and, by the time
the lamps were well lighted, two dense and continuous tides of
population were rushing past the door.  At this particular period of
the evening I had never before been in a similar situation, and the
tumultuous sea of human heads filled me, therefore, with a delicious
novelty of emotion.  I gave up, at length, all care of things within
the hotel, and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without.</p>
          <p>At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn.  I
looked at the passengers in masses, and thought of them in their
aggregate relations.  Soon, however, I descended to details, and
regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure,
dress, air, gait, visage, and expression of countenance.</p>
          <p>By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied
business-like demeanor, and seemed to be thinking only of making
their way through the press.  Their brows were knit, and their eyes
rolled quickly; when pushed against by fellow-wayfarers they
evinced no symptom of impatience, but adjusted their clothes and
hurried on.  Others, still a numerous class, were restless in their
movements, had flushed faces, and talked and gesticulated to
themselves, as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness
of the company around.  When impeded in their progress, these
people suddenly ceased muttering, but re-doubled their
gesticulations, and awaited, with an absent and overdone smile
upon the lips, the course of the persons impeding them.  If jostled,
they bowed profusely to the jostlers, and appeared overwhelmed
with confusion.—There was nothing very distinctive about these
two large classes beyond what I have noted.  Their habiliments
belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent.  They
were undoubtedly noblemen, merchants, attorneys, tradesmen,
stock-jobbers—the Eupatrids and the common-places of society
—men of leisure and men actively engaged
<pb id="poe221" n="221"/>
in affairs of their own—conducting business upon their own
responsibility.  They did not greatly excite my attention.</p>
          <p>The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two
remarkable divisions.  There were the junior clerks of flash
houses—young gentlemen with tight coats, bright boots, well-oiled
hair, and supercilious lips.  Setting aside a certain dapperness of
carriage, which may be termed <hi rend="italics">deskism</hi> for want of a better word,
the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac-simile of what
had been the perfection of <foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">bon ton</hi></foreign> about twelve or eighteen months
before.  They wore the cast-off graces of the gentry;—and this, I
believe, involves the best definition of the class.</p>
          <p>The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms, or of the
“steady old fellows,” it was not possible to mistake.  These were
known by their coats and pantaloons of black or brown, made to sit
comfortably, with white cravats and waistcoats, broad solid-looking
shoes, and thick hose or gaiters.—They had all slightly bald heads,
from which the right ears, long used to pen-holding, had an odd
habit of standing off on end.  I observed that they always removed
or settled their hats with both hands, and wore watches, with short
gold chains of a substantial and ancient pattern.  Theirs was the
affectation of respectability;— if indeed there be an affectation
so honorable.</p>
          <p>There were many individuals of dashing appearance, whom I
easily understood as belonging to the race of swell pick-pockets
with which all great cities are infested.  I watched these gentry with
much inquisitiveness, and found it difficult to imagine how they
should ever be mistaken for gentlemen by gentlemen themselves.
Their voluminousness of wristband, with an air of excessive
frankness, should betray them at once.</p>
          <p>The gamblers, of whom I descried not a few, were still more
easily recognisable.  They wore every variety of dress, from that of
the desperate thimble-rig bully, with velvet waistcoat, fancy
neckerchief, gilt chains, and filagreed buttons, to that of the
scrupulously inornate clergyman, than which nothing could be less
liable to suspicion.  Still all were distinguished by a certain sodden
swarthiness of complexion, a filmy dimness of eye, and pallor and
compression of lip.  There were two other traits,
<pb id="poe222" n="222"/>
moreover, by which I could always detect them;—a guarded
lowness of tone in conversation, and a more than ordinary extension
of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers.
—Very often, in company with these sharpers, I observed an order
of men somewhat different in habits, but still birds of a kindred
feather.  They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their
wits.  They seem to prey upon the public in two battalions—that
of the dandies and that of the military men.  Of the first grade the
leading features are long locks and smiles; of the second frogged
coats and frowns.</p>
          <p>Descending in the scale of what is termed gentility, I found darker
and deeper themes for speculation.  I saw Jew pedlars, with hawk
eyes flashing from countenances whose every other feature wore
only an expression of abject humility; sturdy professional street
beggars scowling upon mendicants of a better stamp, whom despair
alone had driven forth into the night for charity; feeble and ghastly
invalids, upon whom death had placed a sure hand, and who sidled
and tottered through the mob, looking every one beseechingly in the
face, as if in search of some chance consolation, some lost hope;
modest young girls returning from long and late labor to a cheerless
home, and shrinking more tearfully than indignantly from the glances
of ruffians, whose direct contact, even, could not be avoided; women
of the town of all kinds and of all ages—the unequivocal beauty in
the prime of her womanhood, putting one in mind of the statue in
Lucian, with the surface of Parian marble, and the interior filled with
filth—the loathsome and utterly lost leper in rags—the wrinkled,
bejewelled and paint-begrimed beldame, making a last effort at
youth—the mere child of immature form, yet, from long association,
an adept in the dreadful coquetries of her trade, and burning with a
rabid ambition to be ranked the equal of her elders in vice; drunkards
innumerable and indescribable—some in shreds and patches, reeling,
inarticulate, with bruised visage and lack-lustre eyes—some in whole
although filthy garments, with a slightly unsteady swagger, thick
sensual lips, and hearty-looking rubicund faces—others clothed in
materials which had once been good, and which even now were
scrupulously well brushed—men who walked with a more than 
<pb id="poe223" n="223"/>
naturally firm and springy step, but whose countenances were fearfully
pale, whose eyes hideously wild and red, and who clutched with
quivering fingers, as they strode through the crowd, at every object
which came within their reach; beside these, pie-men, porters, coal-
heavers, sweeps; organ-grinders, monkey-exhibiters and ballad
mongers, those who vended with those who sang; ragged artizans and
exhausted laborers of every description, and all full of a noisy and
inordinate vivacity which jarred discordantly upon the ear, and gave
an aching sensation to the eye.</p>
          <p>As the night deepened, so deepened to me the interest of the scene;
for not only did the general character of the crowd materially
alter (its gentler features retiring in the gradual withdrawal of
the more orderly portion of the people, and its harsher ones coming out
into bolder relief, as the late hour brought forth every species of
infamy from its den,) but the rays of the gas-lamps, feeble at first
in their struggle with the dying day, had now at length gained
ascendancy, and threw over every thing a fitful and garish lustre.
All was dark yet splendid—as that ebony to which has been
likened the style of Tertullian.</p>
          <p>The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of
individual faces; and although the rapidity with which the world of
light flitted before the window, prevented me from casting more
than a glance upon each visage, still it seemed that, in my then
peculiar mental state, I could frequently read, even in that brief
interval of a glance, the history of long years.</p>
          <p>With my brow to the glass, I was thus occupied in scrutinizing
the mob, when suddenly there came into view a countenance (that
of a decrepid old man, some sixty-five or seventy years of age,)
—a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole
attention, on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression.
Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never
seen before.  I well remember that my first thought, upon beholding
it, was that Retzch, had he viewed it, would have greatly preferred
it to his own pictural incarnations of the fiend.  As I endeavored,
during the brief minute of my original survey, to form some
analysis of the meaning conveyed, there arose confusedly and
paradoxically within my mind, the ideas of vast mental power, of
caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness,
<pb id="poe224" n="224"/>
of malice, of blood thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of 
excessive terror, of intense—of supreme despair.  I felt singularly
aroused, startled, fascinated.  “How wild a history,” I said to
myself, “is written within that bosom!”  Then came a craving desire
to keep the man in view—to know more of him.  Hurriedly putting
on an overcoat, and seizing my hat and cane, I made my way into
the street, and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had
seen him take; for he had already disappeared.  With some little
difficulty I at length came within sight of him, approached, and
followed him closely, yet cautiously, so as not to attract his
attention.</p>
          <p>I had now a good opportunity of examining his person.  He was short
in stature, very thin, and apparently very feeble.  His clothes,
generally, were filthy and ragged; but as he came, now and then,
within the strong glare of a lamp, I perceived that his linen,
although dirty, was of beautiful texture; and my vision deceived me,
or, through a rent in a closely-buttoned and evidently second-handed
<foreign lang="fre" rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">roquelaire</hi></foreign> which enveloped him, I caught a glimpse both of a diamond
and of a dagger.  These observations heightened my curiosity, and I
resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go.</p>
          <p>It was now fully night-fall, and a thick humid fog hung over the
city, soon ending in a settled and heavy rain.  This change of
weather had an odd effect upon the crowd, the whole of which was at
once put into new commotion, and overshadowed by a world of
umbrellas.  The waver, the jostle, and the hum increased in a tenfold
degree.  For my own part I did not much regard the rain—the lurking
of an old fever in my system rendering the moisture somewhat too
dangerously pleasant.  Tying a handkerchief about my mouth, I kept
on.  For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along
the great thoroughfare; and I here walked close at his elbow through
fear of losing sight of him.  Never once turning his head to look back,
he did not observe me.  By and bye he passed into a cross street,
which, although densely filled with people, was not quite so much
thronged as the main one he had quitted.  Here a change in his
demeanor became evident. He walked more slowly and with less
object than before—more hesitatingly.  He crossed
<pb id="poe225" n="225"/>
and re-crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim; and the
press was still so thick that, at every such movement, I was
obliged to follow him closely.  The street was a narrow and long one,
and his course lay within it for nearly an hour, during which the
passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is
ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the Park—so vast a
difference is there between a London populace and that of the most
frequented American city.  A second turn brought us into a square,
brilliantly lighted, and overflowing with life.  The old manner of the
stranger re-appeared.  His chin fell upon his breast, while his eyes
rolled wildly from under his knit brows, in every direction, upon
those who hemmed him in.  He urged his way steadily and perseveringly.
I was surprised, however, to find, upon his having made the circuit
of the square, that he turned and retraced his steps.  Still more was
I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times—once
nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement.</p>
          <p>In this exercise he spent another hour, at the end of which we met
with far less interruption from passengers than at first.  The rain fell
fast; the air grew cool; and the people were retiring to their homes.
With a gesture of impatience, the wanderer passed into a bye-street
comparatively deserted.  Down this, some quarter of a mile long, he
rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so
aged, and which put me to much trouble in pursuit.  A few minutes
brought us to a large and busy bazaar, with the localities of which
the stranger appeared well acquainted, and where his original
demeanor again became apparent, as he forced his way to and fro,
without aim, among the host of buyers and sellers.</p>
          <p>During the hour and a half, or thereabouts, which we passed in
this place, it required much caution on my part to keep him within
reach without attracting his observation.  Luckily I wore a pair of
caoutchouc over-shoes, and could move about in perfect silence.  At
no moment did he see that I watched him.  He entered shop after
shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with
a wild and vacant stare.  I was now utterly amazed at his behaviour,
and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied
myself in some measure respecting him.</p>
          <pb id="poe226" n="226"/>
          <p>A loud-toned clock struck eleven, and the company were fast
deserting the bazaar.  A shop-keeper, in putting up a shutter, jostled
the old man, and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his
frame.  He hurried into the street, looked anxiously around him for an
instant, and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked
and people-less lanes, until we emerged once more upon the great
thoroughfare whence we had started—the street of the D---- Hotel.  It
no longer wore, however, the same aspect.  It was still brilliant with
gas; but the rain fell fiercely, and there were few persons to be seen.
The stranger grew pale.  He walked moodily some paces up the once
populous avenue, then, with a heavy sigh, turned in the direction of
the river, and, plunging through a great variety of devious ways, came
out, at length, in view of one of the principal theatres.  It was about
being closed, and the audience were thronging from the doors.  I saw
the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the
crowd; but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had,
in some measure, abated.  His head again fell upon his breast; he
appeared as I had seen him at first.  I observed that he now took the
course in which had gone the greater number of the audience—but,
upon the whole, I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of
his actions.</p>
          <p>As he proceeded, the company grew more scattered, and his old
uneasiness and vacillation were resumed.  For some time he followed
closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers; but from this
number one by one dropped off, until three only remained together,
in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented.  The stranger paused,
and, for a moment, seemed lost in thought; then, with every mark of
agitation, pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of
the city, amid regions very different from those we had hitherto
traversed.  It was the most noisome quarter of London, where every
thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty, and of
the most desperate crime.  By the dim light of an accidental lamp,
tall, antique, worm-eaten, wooden tenements were seen tottering to
their fall, in directions so many and capricious that scarce the
semblance of a passage was discernible between them.  The
paving-stones lay at random,
<pb id="poe227" n="227"/>
displaced from their beds by the rankly-growing grass.  Horrible
filth festered in the dammed-up gutters.  The whole atmosphere
teemed with desolation.  Yet, as we proceeded, the sounds of human
life revived by sure degrees, and at length large bands of the most
abandoned of a London populace were seen reeling to and fro.  The
spirits of the old man again flickered up, as a lamp which is near
its death hour.  Once more he strode onward with elastic tread.
Suddenly a corner was turned, a blaze of light burst upon our 
sight, and we stood before one of the huge suburban temples of
Intemperance—one of the palaces of the fiend, Gin.</p>
          <p>It was now nearly day-break; but a number of wretched inebriates
still pressed in and out of the flaunting entrance.  With a half
shriek of joy the old man forced a passage within, resumed at once
his original bearing, and stalked backward and forward, without
apparent object, among the throng.  He had not been thus long
occupied, however, before a rush to the doors gave token that the
host was closing them for the night.  It was something even more
intense than despair that I then observed upon the countenance of
the singular being whom I had watched so pertinaciously.  Yet he did
not hesitate in his career, but, with a mad energy, retraced his steps
at once, to the heart of the mighty London.  Long and swiftly he fled,
while I followed him in the wildest amazement, resolute not to
abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all-absorbing.
The sun arose while we proceeded, and, when we had once again
reached that most thronged mart of the populous town, the street of
the D---- Hotel, it presented an appearance of human bustle and
activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before.
And here, long, amid the momently increasing confusion, did I
persist in my pursuit of the stranger.  But, as usual, he walked to
and fro, and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that
street.  And, as the shades of the second evening came on, I grew
wearied unto death, and, stopping fully in front of the wanderer, gazed
at him steadfastly in the face.  He noticed me not, but resumed his
solemn walk, while I, ceasing to follow, remained absorbed in
contemplation.  “This old man,” I said at length, “is the type and the
genius of deep crime.  He refuses to be alone.
<pb id="poe228" n="228"/>
